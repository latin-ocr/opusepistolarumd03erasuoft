94—2] TO JOHN DRACO 535

Quod Erfordiensis Academiae publico nomine mihi studium illius
ac fauorem et in praesentia testaris et in posterum offers, vehementer
fuit gratum atam inclyta schola probari: neque enim sic amarent,
nisi probarent. Vtinam Eobanum tam non poeniteat suae ad nos 25
profectionis quam ego gaudeo mihi contigisse viri tam eruditi, tam
facundi, tam probi tamque bene morati noticiam! etiamsi ipse
hominem parum humaniter accepi, videlicet id temporis occupatis·
simus, quanquam nunquam non sum occupatus. Bene vale, Draco
charissime. Louanii. Anno M.D.X1x. x1111. calend. Maias. 30

⁸⁵⁰943. To JOHN TURzo.

[There are two manuscripts of this letter : one (a.) in a contemporary hand at
Bremen, with corrections by two other contemporary hands, which are not,
however, worth noting‚ except in two cases (ll. 15, 17); the other (β) in the
volume from which Ep. 850 comes, copied there by the second unknown hand (B).
The manuscripts agree together as against the printed editions in a few points,
which give a presumption that they are derived from the origina13 and they
may therefore take precedence. For the following reasons I have given the
preference to α. It has on the whole the better text, and its orthography is less
harsh than that of Hand B in β. Its heading is cast in a style common in
Erasmus' rough drafts (e. g. Epp. 657—8, 699, 757—8), and its year-date is in the
form which occurs most frequently in Erasmus’ manuscript letters, whether
rough drafts (Epp. 631-6, Suc.) or fair copies (Epp. 537, 913). In 1. 16 there is
trace of an original politeness (cf. Ep. 850. 17 n.) corrected at a later time ; and
the marginal note at 1. 15 definitely indicates a correction by Erasmus,
presumably upon a text written by a secretary. It therefore seems probable
that the copyist of α had for his original a rough draft such as the manuscript
of Ep. 825 (see plate). For β the indications are not so clear-3 but in view
of the volume in which it is found, it may be conjectured that the original was
the letter actually received by Turzo.]
