750] ΤΟ ΜΑΒΤΙΝ LYPSIUS 185

text being clearly that of the letter as actually sent. For the occasional variations
of spelling I have given precedence to Lypsius. There is another copy by
Lypsius in the Codex Horawitzianus‚ with some variations (Horawitz v, p. 17 n.) ;
but the MS. has eluded my inquiries.

A long ‘argument’ by him in α leaves no doubt as to the circumstances under
which the letter was written, and the person to whom it was addi-essed ; though
Epp. 843 and 897 are really ample evidence to identify M. B. here with Martinus
BruxellensiS‚ and the ‘ sycophantic ' critic with Lee (p. 203).

Lypsius' argument runs as follows : ‘Domino Erasmo, insigni theologo, Louanii
in Ioannis Paludani Rhetoris aedibus commorante, quidam e spinosorum
theologistarum numero argutulus satis (euius ob reuerentiam nomen reticeo)
nonnullis ex variis Erasmi opusculis locis aggregatis libellum contra ea contexuit ;
quem exscriptum F. Martinus Bruxell<ensis>‚ canonicus regularis, diaconii offi-
cium in academia vallis Sancti Martini administrans, Erasmiani nominis vbique
defensor, illi transmisit, iungens epistolam (cuius penes vn um Erasmum exemplar
remansit) qua paucis praemissis etiam quae theologus ille in subscriptam Erasmi
annotationem effutierat indicauit. Adnitebatur enim totis neruis vt lapsum
Magistri Sententiarum, vbi traducendi verbo abutitur, excusaret; ac callidis dis-
ceptationibus praedictum diaconum Martinum ferme induxerat vt existimaret
Erasmum false Sententiarum Magistrum taxasse. Porro vbi Erasmus libellum
accepit, disiunctis quaternionibus singulos singulis amiculis circum se legendos
tradidit. Denique deliberatione habita, vt est miro candore praeditus, neniis
theologi illius spretis pium fratris illius affectum non despexit. Nam epistolam
huic annotationi annexam per D. Vrbanum, diui Petri canonicum, (qui etiam
praelibati libelli portitor fuit), ipsi transmisit. Is enim, fratris huius cognatus et
vnus e famulia Paludane domus. aptus negocii huius executor visus est.‘

The ‘libellus’ with which Erasmus here deals is probably the ⁴ decem
conclusiones' of Ep. 843. 17 (cf. Ep. 765. 1) with which the conflict with
Lee began. If Lypsius’ memory is accurate in stating that Lee's notes were
composed while Erasmus was with Paludanus, this letter might be placed as
early as Sept. 1517 (cf. Ep. 651 10 seq.). But it is probably not far distant in time
from Ep. 765, in which Erasmus declines to make use of Lee‘s notes; and I
therefore place it conjecturally in Jan. 1518.

Martin Lypsius or Lipsius (c. 1492—23 March 1555) of Brussels, after being
at some time a pupil of Nicholas of Hertogenbosch (Hora witz v, p. 125)⁷ was placed
by his father in Val St. Mai-tin, a house of Austin canons at Louvain, c. 1508
(ibid. 91 (1510: cf. Ep. 304. 161 n.)); and made his profession there in 1510
(ibid. 89). He seems to have made Erasmus’ acquaintance about this time. and
throughout his life remained his devoted friend and admirer. Evidence of this
are the collections he made of Erasmus' writings in the Codex Horawitzianus
(Horawitz v) and the Brussels MS. 4850-7, both perhaps in his autograph.

His own work was mainly theological. He helped Erasmus with the Basle
edition of Augustine, 1528-9 tHorawitz v. 803 ΕΕ. 69), and with Ambrose
(Horawitz v. 9ο); and this brought him into permanent connexion with the
Basle printers. For the Frobens he revised Erasmus' Augustine, 1543. The
handsome tribute to his work in the preface to its vol. i states that he had been
studying Augustine for 20 years. and that he had completed all except vol. x, in
which he had been interrupted by the Gueldrian invasion of Brabant <in 1542>z
being driven by this to take refuge in the abbey of Neumoustier, near Huy (cf.
his preface to Chromatius, in H. Petri’s Μικροπρεσβυτικον, 1550). In 1547 he
contributed to the Froben Symmachus, Sept. 1549 (cf. Iusti Lipsz' Epz'stolarum decades
xiix, Harderwyk, 1621, p. 100); and he revised for them Erasmus' Hilary in
March 1550. A revision of Erasmus' Cyprian proposed in 1543 (ibid. p. 96) came
to nothing. His work on vol. x of Augustine was finished with the aid of two
pupils, John Coster and John Vlimmer, both afterwards Priors of Val St. Martin,
and appeared in the Froben edition of 1569 and in that published by Plantin for
the theologians of Louvain in 1576—7 ; see also Vlimmer’s preface to his edition
of Augustine’s Sermones, Louvain, Η. Wellaeus, 1564 (Migne xi. 377). Sweert
states that Plantin printed an edition by him of John Custos of Brecht's Latin
grammar; and gives an epitaph which credits him with work on Macrobius.

At intervals during his later years he was warden of a nunnery at Lens
Ste. Croix, near Huy. He was there in (1531) (Basle MS. KA. C. IV. 5, vol. i,
f. 114 v⁰): probably too in 1539-40‚ when he wrote two letters to Boniface
Amerbach, one ‘ex Gallicana Brabantia', about a present of 40 florins made
to him by Erasmus in 1536 (Basle MSS. G. ΙΙ. 20. 294,5; Scheti Epist. f. 41).
