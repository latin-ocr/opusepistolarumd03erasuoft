APPENDIX XIII

THE COPENHAGEN MANUSCRIPT

THE Royal Library at Copenhagen possesses a MS. (G. K. S. 95 fol.)
of 2 53 fohos, which is almost entirely in the handwriting of Erasmus.
Very little information is available externally as to the history of the
manuscript. It was presented to the library by Frederick ΙΙΙ of
Denmark (1648—1670); and its binding is probably of that period.
Its contents also are so varied that they do not give any clear
indication as to the mode of its composition.

They are as follows :—

ff. 1—3. A list of writings by Athanasius, with opening words: in
Greek, in the hand of a secretary.

ff. 4—1 1 2 and 1 18—150. Rough drafts of Erasmus* Ecclesiastes, Book Ι,
Dc praeparatione (th mortem and Aclayia: in his autograph, some-
what hastily written 3 the leaves not always correctly arranged,
as the following scheme will show :——-

Ecclesiaste& ff. 4—9‚ 77-8‚ 10—57‚ 74-6.
De praeparatione: ff. 58—71, 79 ; 72—3 containing passages for
insertion at various points.
Adagyz'a: ff. 147—1503 No. 1493.

ff. 114—5. Index nouorum prouerbiorum3 by a secretary, except for
one entry by Erasmus and a few words hastily written by him.

a number of entries by Erasmus.

a e a ove.

ff. 151-2. Notes on Seneca ; in Erasmus’ autograph.

ff. 15 3-9. Notes on Augustine 3 in Erasmus' autograph.

ff. 160-252. 52 letters, all in Erasmus’ autograph.

f. 253. A copy of Erasmus' last will, dated 12 Feb. 1536 3 written by .
a secretary.

With the exception of the letterS, which are somewhat diverse in

evidence to show. It had been asked for by his friends as far back as
