most improbable in itself, but also quite at variance with his rapidity
in printing the New Testament (Ep. 384 introd.). It may fairly be
concluded, therefore, that Erasmus' preface to F is to be dated 1521 3
a conclusion which is supported by the fact that it is printed on the
first and final sheet, α, with only two other letters, which are dated
13 Aug. and 14 Oct. 1521.

External evidence also is available to corroborate this result. In
July 1520 Erasmus writes to Mosellanus that he is preparing a revi-
sion of the Fen-rayo 3¹ and on 30 Nov. he tells Barland that the work
is dones² Further, in a letter of (c. Jan.) 1521, Froben³ announces
to Boniface Amerbach at Avignon that Erasmus has sent ‘ Epistolare
suum ⁹. Under these circumstances it is evident that Barland’s
volume is prior to F in time.

That Barland’s collection was taken in the main from E is shown
by the various readings. Of the 115 letters which it reprints
from E, just half (58) have no variants in F; but of the remain-
ing 57, 41 invariably follow E where it differs from F. Two
letters, Epp. 279 and 821, appear in both D and E, and are in
consequence twice reprinted in F. In each case Barland’s text
follows ΕΡ2 nine times, as against DF¹ once: the single exceptions
being. in Ep. 279. 13 nemim (f0. d³) for nauem, in Ep. 821. 6 iuuat
(f0. 13²) for iuuet, both perhaps merely accidental.

There are, however, two more categories, 4 letters in which
Ba1·1and·s text follows sometimes E and sometimes F, and. 10
letters in which it follows F against E. In Ep. 56 (f0. k v0.) Bar-
land follows E in ll. 16, 26, and F in 11. 14, 23, 35. In Ep. 123 (f0. k)
Barland follows E 111 11. 19, 23, and F in 11. 6, 8, 15, 18, 26. In Ep.
165 (fv. ivo.) E once and F once in l. 1 by reading a Comteboume;
and F 111 l. 3. In Ep. 264 (fo. k4 v0.) Ε Con-ig! in 1. 25, F in l. 2.

As to the final category, in Ep. 54 (f0. 12 110.) Barland has the
readings introduced in F for 11. 10, 15, 19 : in Epp. 62. 4 (f0. i³), 151. 8
(f0. i4) the easy corrections made in F: 111 Ep. 148 (f0. i⁴) the readings
of F for ll. 4, 5 : in Ep. 163 (f0. 1⁴ v0.) the addition to the title: in
Ep. 225 (f0. 113 v0.) the correction in 1. 20: in Ep. 252 (f0. k⁴) the
addition 111 1. 16 : in Ep. 254 (f0. k3 v0.) the addition to the title: in
Ep. 415 (f0. k³) the necessary addition for l. 7: and in Ep. 918
(f0. 112 v0.) the variation in the opening word.

From the decided character of some of the changes in this last
category it is clear that their agreement with F is not fortuitous:
and this fact coupled with the inclusion in Barland’s volume of six
new letters which were subsequently printed in F, indicates that
Erasmus must have sanctioned the undertaking. It may also be
inferred that he did not begin to interest himself in the book until
it was nearing completion. The new letters are all at the end, Nos.
