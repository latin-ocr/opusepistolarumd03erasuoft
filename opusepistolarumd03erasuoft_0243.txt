765. To EDWARD LEE.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 83. <Louvain.>
LB. App. 238. (c. January 1518.)

[A date may be assigned conjectur ally from the close resemblance to Epp. 766,
778, in the passage about Faber' s book3 especially to Ep. 766.

Edward Lee (‘? 1482 -- 13 Sept. 1544) was a member of a good Kentish family,
who, after degrees at Oxford and Cambridge' 1n 1500 and 1504, received a prebend
at Lincoln in 1512, and in 1515 his B.D. at Cambridge. He was also admitted
to the household of Foxe, Bp. of Winchester (Ep. 912 introd. 3 cf. Ep. 973). In
July 1517 he was studying Greek at Louvain, where he quickly made the
acquaintance of Erasmus (Ep. 607. 15>3 and Ep. 688 shows that he was on
friendly terms with More. The knowledge that Erasmus was engaged upon
a new edition of the Nouum lustramentum encouraged Lee to prepare some criti-
cisms, which he put abroad in ms, first as ‘ decem conclusiones ' (cf. Ep. 750),
and then in a larger book, which was answered in Ep. 843. In the new edition
Erasmus took some notice of Lee's remarks, by introducing into the notes
passages to controvert them ; but Lee was not satisfied, and on Erasmus’ return
from Basle a quarrel, perhaps accentuated by personal antipathy‚ broke out
between them. Lee's charge was that Erasmus had neglected his criticisms
after having invited them 3 and he proceeded to attack the Nouum lustramentum
more persistently. Apologies were put out on both sides, Erasmus being rein·
forced by sundry pamphlets, including a volume of Epz'stolae eruditorum virorum
(Env) in which his English and German friends combined to abuse Lee with
little restraint of decency. Lee’s onset seems to have been evoked, not by the
hostility of orthodoxy‚ but by a desire to win fame. On Erasmus' side the
petulance with which he usually resented public criticism was enhanced by the
consideration that his assailant was a man much younger than himself and
almost unknown. After being carried to absurd lengths the matter ended in
1520. Lee returned to England, to become Royal Almoner in 1523, and to be
entrusted with embassies in following years to Ferdinand, the Emperor, and
the Pope. Henry, finding him a convenient instrument, crowned his prefer-
ment with the Archbishopric of York in 1531, and he continued to serve the
King, though not always without suspicion, in creating a Church of England
separate from Rome but hostile to the Reformers. Ascham, in his Letters, writes
to, and of, Lee with affection.

See DN B. A. Bludau, Erasmus-Ausyaben cles Neuen Test„ pp. Sei-125, gives
a detailed account of the controversy; and the case for Lee is stated by J. S.
Brewer, Enylish Studies, 1881, pp. 373-6.]
