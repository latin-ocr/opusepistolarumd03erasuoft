108 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1517

meis tibi accedere posse, quemadmodum nec solis claritati luminarium
splendor. Nolui tamen animi mei beniuolentiam ac singularem quo
tibi deuinctus sum amorem te latere, 1100 egre laturum puto, si idem
in reliquis monimentis, etsi minus digne, fecero: siquidem et Deum
2 Optimum et Maximum sepe ab indignis adorari cernimus. Tu igitur
boni consules si ab homine amicissimo vel frigide laudaris.

Vale, mi optime Erasme, et iterum oro tantum ocii susureris vt
desiderio nostro satisfacias.

[1517, because between the death of Jerome Busleiden and the publication
ofDl.

Gilles, seigneur of Busleiden (c. 1465 — 1536), and elder brother of Francis,
Archbishop of Besancon (Ep. 157. 59 n.), and Jerome (Ep. 205 inti-oa), was
councillor and accountant·gene1·al of Brabant in 1505 (Henne i. 63), Though
not an executor of his brother's will, he fron] the first had great weight in
the affairs of the Collegium trilingue. Epp. 691, 699, 804 show Erasmus writing
to him about the appointment of a professor at this time 3 and Lond. xxx. 55,
LB. 1207, in 1531 is on a similar theme. The first volume from the press
of Rescius (Ep. 546 inti-od.), the Memorabilia os Xenophon, Sept. 1529, is dedicated
to him.
