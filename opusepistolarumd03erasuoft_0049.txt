602] ΤΟ JOHN FROBEN 13

evident that there must have been an earlier budget to convey that news. It
may be doubted, too, whether this letter can be of the same period as Ep. 629,
for if they were contemporary, one of them might be expected to contain an
allusion to the other. I therefore conjecture that this letter was written in
haste, on the first sight of Badius' book; which may be supposed to have
reached Erasmus at Louvain about the middle of July, since Ep. 609, 17 Ju1y‚
reached him early in August (cf. Ep. 617).

The first sentence of the letter might be interpreted to mean a charge of
piracy3 but as the suggested preface only complains of underselling, it seems
probable that Erasmus merely intended to send news that Badius had under-
taken the same volume as Froben.

It may be noted that this manuscript supplies another example of a preface
written in a printer's name; cf. those composed for the Amorbachs in Jerome
(Ep. 396 introd.), and see also p. 98.]

S. D. BAn1vs imitatus est tuum opus, addita prefatione qua testatur
librum duplo minoris iam emi posse. Tu contra potes tali vti

prefatione.
10. FROB. CANDIDO LECTORI S. D.

Mihi semper studio fuit in excudendis libris vt non minus bonis
studiis publice consulerem quam priuatim meo questui, et meam
operam optimis probarem potius quam plurimis. Atque vtinam
hoc animo sint omnes typographi, et rem sacram pure sancteque
tractarent! Nunc sunt qui tantum hoc agunt vt studiorum detri-
mento suo -consulant compendio, nec alia re commendant libros
emptori quam vilitate, hoc freti paucissimos esse qui recte de libris
iudicent. Non hac lege coensentur tabulae, non equi, non vina,
vt maxime sit vendibile quod Nemi possit minimo. Gur in libris
minus sapimus quam in rebus leuioris momenti? Paruo emit
quisquis librum emendatum etiam magno emit. Magno emit quis-
quis codicem 'mendosum etiam minimo emit. Expende tecum,
optime lector, quantum impendii detur toties emendandis exempla-
ribus. Id nisi a doctis viris prestari non potest, et horum opera

non conducitur paruo. Tua igitur non minus refert quam mea:

quod te rogabo, lector optime, vt meo in excudendis libris syncero
studio tuum in emendis syncerum iudicium respondeat. Bene vale.

D. Ioanni Frobenio.

Querela Pacis f0. a2. <L0uvain.>
Lond. xxix, 61 ε LB. iv. 625. (July‘? 1517.)

[The preface to the Querela Pacis. Of the composition of this work Erasmus
says (1. pp. 18, 9) that it was written shortly after his appointment as
councillor (Ep. 370. 18 n.) at the request of John Le Sauvage, when the
conference at Cambray was being mooted which took place in March 1517
(Creighton iv. 241⁷ 2) ε his calculation that he wrote it ‘ante annos ferme septem '
(1. p. 18. 29, 30) is thus perhaps correct, is we suppose that it was proposed by
Le Sauvage on the occasion of Erasmus' visit to Brussels in July 1516 (ΕΡ. 438
introd.). The preface‚ however, though possibly composed earlier (cf. Ep. 199),
