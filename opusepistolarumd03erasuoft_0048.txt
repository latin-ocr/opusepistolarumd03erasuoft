12 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1517

credas quam auide expectem, quamque male precer illi morbo qui

602. To JOHN FROBEN.

Basle MS. G. II. 13²². 43. <Louvain.>
<July 1517·>

[An autograph throughout. Μ. Philippe Renouard has kindly allowed me to
avail myself of his intimate knowledge of Badius' publicatione, and in answer-
to my inquiry at once indicated that the book here referred to is the Antiquae
Lectiones of Caelius Rhodiginus. The first edition of this was published by the
Aldine firm in Feb. 1516, and a copy reached Froben through the Frankfort
fair in Sept. 1516 (Ep. 469. 8n.). He printed it in the winter of 1516-7
(Ep. 556. 275, and the colophon is dated 18 March 1517 (not 1518, as Panzer).
Meanwhile Badius also was reproducing the Aldine edition, 13 June 1517, and
in his preface of the same date, to Remigius Ru-ffus, he writes: ‘Tu enim istis
libris quos mihi suppeditasti non carebas, at sciebas duplo minoris asnobis quam ab
reliquis redimendos’ (cf Ph. Renouard, Biblioqraphie de Josse Badius, iii. 209,10).
But the priority of Frobens edition is apparent, not rea13 for its title· p-age
contains on the recto the preface suggested here by Erasmlis, which can only
have been written after the appearance of Badius' volume.

For this conflict of dates three explanations are possible: (1) that Froben s
book' is to be dated in March 1512. (2) that the British Museum copy, which
is the only one 1 have examined-eit once belonged to John Toker, Gardinal
College, Oxford—is a re· issue with a new title· -page. (3) that the substantive
part of the book was completed by the date given in the colophon, but that this
being too late for the Frankfort spring fair, the introductory sheets (foi-ty
folios of indexes, &c.‚ with separate signatures) were finished more leisurely3
and that thus there was time for Erasmus' preface to be included. No. 1 seems
to me improbable. The German year usually began at Christmas or 1 Jan.,
and Ι know of no other instance in which Froben uses the ‘old style’ ; though
Erasmus sometimes adopts it in his letters to friends who were accustomed to
it (cf. Ep. 522 introd.). Of the practice suggested in No. 2 Dr. Bernoulli has
shown me an example in two copies of the Adaqia of 1515 (Ep. 269 introd.) in
the Basle University Library, where the title—pages differ considerably, but
otherwise there is no apparent variation. But though this was doubtless done
in other cases also, there is no suggestion in this letter of substituting a new
preface for one already used ; and I therefore prefer the third explanation.

As to the date, there is no clear indication as to Erasmus' correspondence
with Basle in the summer of 1517, except that he sent one packet in May
(Ep. 584. 15), which was answered from Basle, c. 13 July (Epp. 598, 9); and
that he replied to these answers with another budget of letters, c. 23 Aug. (Epp.
625-35). But as none of these announce Erasmus' arrival at Louvain, it is
