[Chr. Longolius (c. 1488—- 11 Sept. 1522), ‘ une sorte de} Pie de la Mirandole
francais,’ was born at Mechlin‚ a natural son of Antony, Bp. of St. Pol de Leon
(ζῇ-25 Aug. 1500), who belonged to the Norman family of Longueil. About 1497
he was sent to Paris to be educated, and after eight years was taken to Spain in
the train of Andrew de Burgo, Maximilian's ambassador. On the death of
Philip the Fair he returned, and betook himself to the study of Civil Law, first
at Bologna in 1507 (ANGB. p. 269) and then at Poitiers, where he ultimately
lectured (ef. Ep. 935. 5 n.) and taught. In the preface, 19 Aug. 1512, to an
edition of the Itinerary of Antoninus, Paris, H. Stephanus, ε. α., Godfrey Torinus
states that the MS. came ‘ex Morinis ’, and had been lent to him four years ago
by ‘Longuolius’‚ who had now just returned from Poitiers to Paris. In 1514
he was at Valence, attending the lectures of Philip Decius, from whom he
received his licence to proceed D.C.L. In 1515 he was a member of the Parlia-
ment of Paris, but soon abandoned the practical life for literature, under the
influence of Budaeus, Deloynes and Ruze ; to the last of whom he was especially
indebted (cf. BE‘. 62). In 1517 he went to Rome, and studied under Musurus
and John Lascaris ; and guided by Bembo and Sadolet became a Ciceronian. As
a Northerner, who in praising St. Louis had extolled France at the expense of
Italy, he met with some hostility ; and a proposal that he should be presented
with the citizenship of Rome was vigorously opposed. His friends secured for
him from the Pope a protonotaryship and a pension 3 but he was obliged to leave
Rome. By the middle of June 1519 he was in Paris, and thence went to
England (BE4. 34, 40), returning to France through Louvain, where he visited
Erasmus 15,6 Oct. In Dec. he joined Bembo at Venice, and gave himself up
