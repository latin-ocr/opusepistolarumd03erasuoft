504 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1519

About this time he was chosen as tutor to the young Colignys, Gaspard,
afterwards Admiral of Franco, and his elder brother Odet, who in 1533 at
the age of 16 was created Cardinal, and in 1534 Abp. of Toulouse; and with them
he spent some years at Chatillon sur Loing in the Orleanais. In 1535 he accom-
panied the Cardinal to his see (EE2. 142), where he made the acquaintance of

John de Pins (Ep. 928. 36 n.). He was in Paris c. March 1537 at the reception
given to Dolet on his release from prison; and was still in Goligny's service
29 March 1538—the last certain date in his life.

See M. Delaruelle in Rev. des bibliotheques xii (1902), 421-45, and Muse'e helye xiii
(1909), 253—312 ; also BE, and R. C. Christie, Etienrae Dolet. Some autograph
letters to Beraldus are preserved in the Public Library at Berne (see H. Hagen's

catalogue nos 141, 4503 and Herminjard 475, 483) among the papers of Peter
Daniel ; inherited from his father Francis Daniel, who was a contemporary of

Beraldus in the confidence of the Ooligny family (see a sketch of P. Daniel by
H. Hagen, 1873, pp. 4-6). “

Erasmus first met Beraldus in 1506, when, on his way to Italy, he was
received as a guest in his house at Orleans for some days. Ten years later
when this was recalled to his memory (Ep. 494. 65—9>‚ he responded with an
eloquent description of Beraldus’ natural gifts for teaching (Ep. 535. 38-49).
Their relations continued friendly throughout their lives. In 1522 he dedicated
to Beraldus the authorized edition of the De conscribendis Epistolis (Ep. 71 introd.);
and in editing Pliny in 1525 110 speaks highly of his attainmcnts as a scholar

(Lond. xxviii. 14, LB. 730).]

D0Lv1 vehementer ac saepe, Erasme doctissime, binas meas ad te
literas proximo scriptas biennio periisse: periisse enirn puto quibus
nihil responderis. Id autem Francisci Calui, qui eas Basileam vsque
ad te perferendas receperat, negligentiae malo quam dolo adscribere,

vnius congressu spectasse. Interea ineptum putabam aliis te literis
obtundere, studiis praesertim grauioribus occupatum ι nimirum resti-
tuendae rei theologicae annos iam aliquot deditum, Paulinisque
epistolis illustrandis toto, vt dicitur, pectore vigiliisque ac sudoribus

alteram abs te paratam esse nihil dubito, affirmante id praesertim
Neseno nostro3 qui se quoque luculentas enarrationes tuas in Pauli

2. literas] Probably one of these
was written in the spring of 1518
(perhaps c. 20 April with Ep. 819 ; cf.
Ep. 989. 2) and sent by Calvus, the
bookseller (Ep. 581. 30 n.), in the

phrases (Epp. 710, 916) ; for the latter
would probably have been seen by
Beraldus by now, and moreover had
already been printed by Froben. Even
if Beraldus was unaware of the latter

expectation that it would find Eras-
mus at Basle, but actually was delivered
at Louvain at the end of April (cf. Lond.
xi. 15, LB. 327). The other letter was
presumably earlier, since they are de-
scribed as ‘proximo scriptas biennio '.
7. obtundere] Cf. Cic. ad Att. 8. 1. 4.
12. enarrationes] The Commen taries‚
of which Beraldus would have read in
Epp- 164· 39, 373- mes-perhaps 2180
in Ep. 296. 157, e-not the Para—

fact, and had merely been told by
Nesen of Martens' editions, it is not
likely that he would have laid stress
on having reprints by Froben. Nesen⁴
had no doubt seen the Commentaries
during his period of intimacy with
Erasmus at Basle 3 cf. Ep. 502 introd.
For the eagerness with which the
publication of them was awaited see
Ep. 500. 5-8. For Nesen’s presence in
Paris see p. 497.
