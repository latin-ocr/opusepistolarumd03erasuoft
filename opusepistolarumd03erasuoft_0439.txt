864. FROM LEo X.

Nouum Testamentum (1519) tit. v0. Rome.
Lond. xxix. 80: LB. vi. 1⁰. ÷÷ νο. 10 September 1518.

[The Brief desired in Ep. 832 and sought in Ep. 860. For the delay in
obtaining it see Ep. 865; which shows that the dates are fictitious, the Pope
having been absent from Rome at the time when this is supposed to have been
signed. It was printed in the second edition of Erasmus’ New Testament‚ and
in all the other Froben editions published during his lifetime. There is a xvi0.
copy of the Brief in the Deventer MS. 99, f. 6 ; but as its two variants are mere
degenerations, it was probably copied from some one of the printed texts, and
may therefore be neglected. Resides the Brief Leo granted Froben a privilege
of copyright (Apol. adu. debacch. sutoris, LB. ix. 751 Ε).

Some account is given in Ep. 384 introd. of the coinmencement of Erasmus’
revision of his text and of the introduction of his original translation. Of this
latter feature there is perhaps a trace in Ep. 809. 64 ; and cf. Ep. 860. 35 n. The
work was carried on steadily from the time of his return to the Netherlands in
Aug. 15163 at Antwerp‚ at Brussels‚ at Ghent, at Bruges (cf. Ep. 597. 16 n.), at
Louvain. By Nov. 1517 he felt that he had made good progress (Epp. 694, 695),
and in Jan. 1518 the end of his part in the work was in sight (Ep. 768). At
Basle he made a thorough revision of the notes, and 'that volume was completed
before the text was begun (Apoloqia qua respondet f0. A43 J ortin ii. 498‚9)‚ the
colophon being dated 23 Aug. 1518. On his way back to the Netherlands he
was at work on the text, and this was finished at Louvain (Ep. 867. 76⁴7, 236).
The ‘copy‘ was dispatched to Basle at the end of Oct. (Epp. 882, 885-63‚ only the
introductory matter being still unfinished. In Dec. the printing had advanced
as far as the Epistles (Ep. 904. 12-4), and the date 1518 is affixed to the text. In
March (cf. LE2. 149) the book appeared.

About 2000 copies were printed3 a figure which is obtained from Erasmus’
statements that 3300 copies were prInted of the first and second editions together
(Resp. ad annot. nouas Lei, LB. ix. 2801)), and that more than 1200 were printed
of the first (Apol. qua respondet f0. A3 3 Jortin ii. 497).
