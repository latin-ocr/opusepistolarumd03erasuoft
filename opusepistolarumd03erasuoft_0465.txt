875] ΤΟ JOHN WERTER 413

putant quod illum magno suo malo adierint, aut Christo imputant
quod ingenti periculo suo Hierosolymam viserint: cum vtrumque
verioribus officiis domi licuisset demereri. Iampridem in libris
meliorem Erasmi videras imaginem, si qua tamen bona est‚⁴imo
iuxta Platonem totum videras Erasmum. Quid igitur supererat
tantis expetendum itineribus? Verus amor animis constat, quem
saepenumero vel dissoluit vel minuit corporum coniunctio. Sed in-
humanus sim si vere succenseam tibi ; qui ob hoc ipsum dignus es
qui redameris, quod amas impotentius. Bene vale.

[Jodoeus (5 June 1493 -— 9 Oct. 1555), son of Jonas Koch, of Nordhausen in
Thuringia, was known among the Reformers as J ustus Jonas. He matriculated
at Erfurt in 1506, and was Β.Α. 1507, Μ.Α. 1510. Ι11 1511 116 moved to
Wittenberg and became LL.B.; but later was ordained priest and returned
to Erfurt, where he proceeded LL.D., and like Draco received a canonry at
St. Severus’. Under Eobanus’ influence he became an ardent admirer of
Erasmus, and followed up the letter here answered with a visit to Erasmus in
May 1519 (cf. Ep. 963. 1 n.). During the month and a half of his absence (JE. 25)
he was elected Rector (2 May), and the progress of humanism in the University
seemed thereby assui-ed, But, as with Dram, the influence of Wittenberg
gradually prevailed. He accompanied Luther to Worms, and in June 1521
migrated to Wittenberg as Professor of Canon Law 3 from which he soon
transferred himself to theology‚ becoming D.D. 14 Oct. Erasmus did what
he could to hold him back, first by direct appeal (Lond. xvii. 18, LB. 572)
and then by the presentment of a picture of churchmanship which combined
reform with orthodoxy (Lond. xv. 14, LB. 435) ; but without avail. In Feb. 1522
Jonas married and definitely threw in his lot with the Evangelical party 3 though
it wasnot till Oct. 1527 that he could be brought to condemn Erasmus (J E. 107,
LE2. 1216). For twenty years he remained at Wittenberg in close contact with
Luther and Melanchthon, many of whose works he translated into German
or Latin. From 1541-6 and 1548-51 he was ⁴ Bishop ¹ of the reformed church at
Halle ; but his last years were spent in need.
