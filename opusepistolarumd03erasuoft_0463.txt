[Eobanus Coci (6 Jan. 1488 — 4 Oct. 1540) was born of poor parents at Halge-
hausen, near Frankenberg in Hesse. He was cliristened after a companion of
St. Boniface, buried at Erfurt and honoured throughout Thuringia, and later he
prefixed the name Helius as having been born on a Sunday. After attending
the Latin schools of Gemiinden (till 1502) and Frankenberg, he matriculated at
Erfurt in'1504 and was B.A. 1506, schoolmaster at St. Severus’ 1507-8, M.A.'1509.
Failing of support he left Erfurt and found patronage from -Job of Dobeneck, Bp.
of pomerania, who in 1513 sent him to the universities of Frankfort-on-the-Oder
and Leipzig. Since 1506 he had been publishing numerous verses ; but now the
appearance of his Heroides (Ep. 871. 14 n.) obtained him widespread recognition
as a poet. In 1517 he was appointed to a Classical lectureship at Erfurt, and for
a few years he was the head ofa circle of young ‘poet-s ’, who united in rendering
homage first to Erasmus and then to Luther. Many of his friends, Lang, Draco,
Jonas, were prepared to follow Luther far; but from the schism that threatened
Eobanus recoiled. The University declined rapfflly, and he found himself almost
alone. After vain efforts to support himself by studying medicine he moved to
Nuremberg in 1526 to teach. He was recalled to Erfurt 1533-6‚ but then until
his death he was Professor of History at Marburg.

The admiration which he felt for Erasmus on the occasion of this visit (p. 405)
eooled under the first attraction towards Luther3 and the exchange of letters
between them in 1531 led to no real revival of amity. In his later life he pro-
duced a number of verse-translations, the best known being those of Theocritus
(1531) and the Iliad (1540).
