102 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 7

superiorem bellum aggredi temerarium esse, ita contra parem peri-
culosum. Noui hominis modestiam et candidam in omnes et doctos
et bonos affectionem⁷ quippe qui eius fuerim aliquot annis discipulus 3
atque idem, vt sophistas imprimis mordere atque acriter impugnare
consueuerat, ita doctissimum quenque commendare ac laudibus de·
bitis ornare. Itaque esse non potest, quod et tu quoque ita sentis,
quin a pessimo aliquo daemone instigatus sit: 0111 vtinam obstitisset,
et tuam potius erga se beneuolentiam fouere curasset, vt per quam

Sed hactenus de 1100 satis. Neaetius noster curauit his diebus
imprimi libellum quendam ex Vrbe allatum, titulo Defensionis

quaeso cum primo tabellario mihi rescribito. Vale optime.
