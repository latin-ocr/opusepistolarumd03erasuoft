14 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1517

was almost certainly not dedicated to Philip until after his election to the·
bishopric of Utrecht ; and it was doubtless intended as a mark of appreciation
of the Bishop's invitations (Epp. 682, 714, 727) which Erasmus suceeeded in
declining. By the end of August (Ep. 645) the book had been sent to Basle,
and Erasmus supposed it to be in the press3 the dedication being described as
made ‘iamdudum ’. It may therefore be dated at some time in the summer of
15173 perhaps when Erasmus was sending to Basle in July (Ep. 602 introd.),
or possibly even earlier, in May (cf. Epp. 584. 15—7‚ 597. 43). An indication of
the date of the book is given by the fact that it occurs among the volumes shown
in the Antwerp copy of Metsys' porti-ait of Gilles (Ep. 584. 6 n.): ovare. PAc1s
Erus. Ror‘r.

Erasmus‘ subsequent correspondence with the Bishop and his secretary,
Geldenhauer, needs elucidation. Mr. Nichols indeed has proposed some
corrections of the dates given for the letters3 but 1 follow Dr. Reich in retaining
them unchanged. It appears that in Sept. Erasmus grew tired of the delay
over the printing, and had a manuscript copy made of the Querela, which he
dispatched on 5 Oct. (cf. Ep. 682). His accompanying letter to the Bishop
(Ep. 727. 3) is lost. The messenger found the Bishop on progress at Kampen and
just starting for Deventer, 15 (‘?) Oct. (Ep. 727. 1 n.); so that there was only
time for Geldenhauer to convey his patron's thanks in a hasty note now lost
(Ep. 727. 43 cf. Epp. 714. 1, 722. 20, 756, 761). Erasmus wrote replies to the
Bishop (now lost) and to Geldenhauer (Ep. 714); and to these answers came
from Vollenhove expressing the Bishop‘s appreciation more amply (Epp. 727, 8).

Before long Erasmus, impatient at Froben's delays, gave the book to Martens
also to print. Luc. Ind. (Jan. 1519) says that it had been ‘per Theodoricum
primum, mox per Frobenium bis excusa'. Froben's edition appeared in Dec.
1517 (a), Martens' c. 30 March 1518 (β), with some additional matter (cf. Epp.
604. 10 n. and 799) ; and there is a second Froben edition of Nov. 1518 (γ). 111
all three and in an undated (Strasburg) edition (which, to judge from a single
misprint, amplectarentur, 1. 287 seems to have supplied the original to Lond.) the
text of this preface is unaltered ; but some changes were introduced in the only
other authorized edition ever published in Erasmus' lifetime, with the De pueris
instituendis, Basle, H. Froben, J. Herwagen and Nic. Episcopius, Sept. 1529 (δ).
Froben’s 1517 edition represents the first copy from Erasmus’ original manu-
script. Martens’ claim to priority probably rests on the fact that the second
part of Froben’s volume was not completed till March 1518 (Ep. 550 introd.);
the two parts reaching Louvain together.

Philip (c. 1464—7 April 1524), one of the many natural sons of Philip the Good
of Burgundy (11467), was brought to court at the age of 12, and by 1482 was one
of Maximilian’s commanders. 'l'hen for a few years he was coadjutor to his
brother David (l. 11 n.) at Utrecht; but cf. Aday. 2838. By 1500 he was Admiral
of Flanders, in which capacity he accompanied the Archduke Philip to Spain in
1501-3 ; and in 1505—6 Philip made him governor of his conquests in Gueldres.
In 1508 (2²) Maximilian sent him on an embassy to Rome, where he was delighted
with the art—treasures but horrified at the morals of the Papal Court. In March
1517 (Brewer ii. 3015) he was elected Bishop of Utrecht ; and for the rest of his
life he was one of the pillars of Margaret’s government in the Netherlands. His
post as Admiral passed to his great-nephew Adolphus of Veere (Ep. 93 introd.).
