(ἶ) Liedel : c. 149o—Oct. 1549), of Metz.
He was a student at Louvain c. 1512.
and a friend there of Dorp (cf. BRE.
121). From Christmas 1516 to Easter
15 19 he received a grant from the town of
Metz for the furtherance of his studies.
With this in the summer of 1517 he
matriculated at Basle3 where in the
autumn of 1518 he was appointed Pro-
fessor of civil Law, and in Oct. 1519
was Rector. But he was not satisfied
with his position, even when he be-
came Syndic of Basle in June 1522;
and made attempts to move to Freiburg
and Mainz. In J uly 1523 he was in
Paris, perhaps on a similar quest, and
carried 3 letter from Francis 1 inviting
Erasmus to France (Vischer‚ p. 31 ; cf.
Horawitz 11. 4). During his residence
at Basle he composed his Topica (Ep.
447. 596 n.)‚ and translated Erasmus'
Exomologesis into Freneh, Basle, 26 April
1524, probably also his Precatio dmnivzica ;

elaims found time to publish Parn-
phrases of the Institutes of J ustinian,
1533-8. From Oct. 1540 until his
death he was Austrian Chancellor at
Ensisheim.

Zasius admired his legal ability
greatly, and dedicated to him one part
of his Lucubratimzes. In Oct. 1525 he
was appointed by the Senate of Basle,
with Erasmus, Ber and Boniface Amer-
bach to examine a book by Oecolampa-
diuswhich was suspected of heterodoxy.
