BRE. 45). He was a school-fellow of Glareanus under Michael Rubell at
Rottweil. On 31 May 1510 he matriculated at Basle, and after his B.A. in 1514
he was appointed master of St. Peter’s school there. Several episodes of his life
in ¹515-6 are recorded by him in the illustrated Morta. Between Sept. and Nov.
1516 (Epp. 463. 73, 490. 14‚5) he moved to Zurich to be head of the school at the
Great Minster, and there became fast friends with Zwingli. At this time he was
interested in the geography of Switzerhmd, writing on the subject himself and
editing (cf. VE. 137) Glareanus' De situ Helzoetiae. Basle, Froben, March 1519. He
also lectured publicly 011 Erasmus' Paraclesis and Methodus (BRE. 88, 90, 115). Late
in 1519 (Zw. E2.104—5‚ 109, 114) 110 was invited to open a school in his native
town ; but the influence of Zwingli had drawn him to reform, and in 1522 he
was compelled to resign and leave Lucerne. After a period at Einsiedeln
(VE. 334) 110 returned to Zurich, where he was head of the Fraumiinster school,
and lived in great intimacy with Zwingli, until the latter’s death in 1531. He
then accepted an invitation from Basle to become pastor of St. Alban’s church,
aud on 13 Aug. 1532, to Erasmus' disgust (Lond. xxx. 59, LB. 1233), was elected
to succeed Oecolampadius as professor of theology (ΥΕ. 709, 711). Τ1118 011311 110
filled until his death ; but his theologieal writings are not notable.

s A letter of commendation for Zasius* Lucum-atianes, Basle, Froben, 1518.
The book consists in the main of legal work, the first item being the com-
mentaries De origine iuris, which Zasius had submitted to Erasmus in 1515-6
(Epp. 367, 376, 380, 390), and had been enoouraged by him to publish (Ep. 379).
In Aug. 1517⁷ perhaps in response to suggestions from Freiburg, Erasmus invited
Froben to undertake the book (Ep. 632) 3 and when he came to Basle in 1518,
some more of the work was put before him in ms. On 8 Sept. 1518 Bruno Amor-
bach wrote to Boniface at Freiburg, announcing that Erasmus had written this
letter of praise‚ and enclosing a specimen of the type and format that Froben
proposed to adopt. Zasius accepted the specimen with alacrity, and the work
was undertaken (Basle MSS. (ὲ. ΙΙ. 13. 107—9; which are printed in Stintzing’s
Zasius, pp. 366-8). On 5 Dee. its progress was still delayed by other books
(Ep. 904). But it was perhaps only awaiting the final process of printing 0ff;
for the colophon is dated 1518. Zasius was dissatisfied with the ‘correction'3
and at his remonstrance a sheet of errata was added in J an. 1519 to the copies

5. Nos hinc] Myconius quotes this hasty departure from Basle that Eras-
sentence <VE.133‚ from Zurich‚15 Sept. mus had left a letter from Vadianus
1518) in explaining that it was through unanswered.
