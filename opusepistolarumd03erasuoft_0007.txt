PREFACE

AS this work proceeds I have an increasing sense of what, 11
owes 1ο others. Erasmus was a great traveller3 and his 1011018,
100, 110νο wandered 11110 many lands—not always those 10 which
they were addressed. Ι1 is a 0011111111οΙ pleasure 10 recall 1101
merely 1110 ready welcome accorded 10 us in the numerous
libraries and archives 11 has been necessary 10 visit, but also
13110 sympathetic interest, which has led these welcoming friends
10 remember our studies, and 10 report, and even 10 make,
discoveries likely 10 be of value.

The most important of these has been contributed by Professor
Roersch of Ghent3 who found a clue which enabled him 10 11000
1110 de Ram collection of Erasmus' 10131010 10 Schetus and Vander
Νο013 111 1110 possession of M. Louis Neve of Louvain. Though
engaged himself in widely different pursuibs, M. Neve 01 once
recognized 1110 imporbance of 1110 discovery, and with 1110 utmost
generosiby allowed Professor Roersch 10 place 1110111 111 our hands
01 Ghent in June 1910, 10 be copied. Since 111011, with 1110
instinct of a 11110 scholar, he has made 11 easy for 1110111 10 pass
in 11νο divisions 11110 1110 Eritish Museum and 1110 Bodleian,
rather 111011 submit them 10 be scabtered by 1110 chauces of 1110
market-place.

less acceptable, for 1110 10011 of books, for advice given, and for
