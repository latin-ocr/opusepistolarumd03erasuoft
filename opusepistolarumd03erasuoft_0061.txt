numeros habent libros, vt interim vacare huic rei minime possint.

Dominus meus, Noue Aquile Comes illustris, et ego non raro
de te loquimur, et maximopere tuum probamus propositum in bonis
litteris in lucem reuocandis, et tui socii esse cuperemus, modo tam
feliciter res nobis succedere posset. Vale optime. 45

narrando tibi contexere velim, Erasme doctissime, nullus tam longus
est dies qui mihi satis fuerit ; ita varie iactatus sum. Capita tamen

610. 47. Tilmanno] Gravius or a Fossa
(‘? vom Graben), born 1474 (⁶3), matri-
culated at Oologne 27 Sept. 1496. From
1512 to 1544 his name occurs as Secre-

his children. Cervicornus speaks of
him as a patron and praises his library.
ME. 6280, 14 July 1557, is perhaps ad-
dressed to him. See Ennen, Gesch. d.

tary to the Chapter of Cologne Cathe-
dral; and in that position he was
intimate with the Bp., Hermann of
Wied. By 1527 he was father of eight
children, one of whom was for a time
in Erasmus’ household in 1533 (ΕΕ.
196,7) and gave his father much
trouble (Zs. d. bery. Geschichtsvereins, xxx,
1894, p. 202). In 1535 Tilmann con-
templated taking orders (EE. 224).
Erasmus dedicated to him Lactantius'
cle OpificiO, Basle, Η. Froben and J.
Herwagen, March 1529; and John
Oldendorp, the jurist, a treatise De
iure et aequitate, Cologne, J. Gymnich,
1541, with a preface lauding him and

Stadth'ln, iv, pp. 111, 4663 and Varren-
trapp, Herm. von Wied, 1878, pp. 90—1.
Georgio] 5Geo. Johannis of Rot-

terdam. He matriculated at Cologne
9 June 1504, and in 1512 was a mem-
ber of the Bursa Corneliana. In 1513
he entered the Council of the Arts
Faculty, and in 1514 was an examiner.
After the mention in Ep. 615. 1 nothing
seems to be known of him. See Butz-
bach, Heft 2, 1875, pp. 26,7.
