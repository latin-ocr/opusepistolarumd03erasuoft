FROM ANTONY CLAVA.

Ghent.
3 August (1517).

[Both Dr. Reich and Mr. Nichols place this letter in 1516, in reliance on an
unfounded year-date added in LB. But it is clear from the friends to whom
messages are sent that the letter is addressed to Louvain. In 1517 Erasmus
was settled there at this time; but a visit in 1516, though possible, is hardly
likely, since he was already prepared to start for England in the middle of J uly

he supervised Martens' editions of
Hugo of St. Victor on St. Paul, 18 Nov.
1512, and Richard of St. Victor on the
Apocalypse, 7 Sept. 1513; cf. also Dorp's
preface, 22 Nov. <1512‘?> to Aesop, 21
Sept. 1513, and Despauterius' syntaxis,
with preface dated 10 J uly 1513, dedi-
cated to Nicholas conjointly with Dorp
and another. In 1517 and till 1521 he
was master of the Latin school at
Antwerp (cf. Epp. 637, 788, 7943 and
Lond. xiii. 25, LB. 482), and also
worked for Hillen (cf. Erasmus’ Apolo-
9ia qua respondet, 1²⁰. Β3 : J ortin ii. 502),
editing Dorp’s Oratio, 27 Sept. 1519 (Ep.
438 and BRE. 126), and some of Eras-
mus' translations from Lucian, 1517
and later. Geldenhauer dedicated to
him De Batauorum insula, HiHen, 19
Sept. 15203 and Corn. Grapheus the
Epistola apologetica of J 0. Gochius‚ s.a.et L,
with preface dated Antwerp, 23 Aug.
(1521 ἲ). 111 1521-2 116 was im·
prisoned for Lutheranism‚ and com-
pelled to recant publicly at Brussels
(Geldenhauer's Collectanea, ed. Prinsen,
pp. 46,7; cf. EE. 10). Through the
intercession of friends, including Eras-
mus (Lond. xix. 112, xx. 403 LB. 629,
644), he was released c. March 1523
(BE. 13 and Lond. xxi. 1, LB. 653);
and made his way to Basle (Jortin
ii. 414). By Nov. he had returned to
Antwerp (EE. 19). About Feb. 1524
116 was at Louvain and visited M. Lyp-
sius (Horawitz v, p. 65). But his
sympathies with Luther were un·
changed, and in May 1525 Lypsius
writes urging him not to quarrel with
Erasmus (ibid. Ep. 67), whose con-
fidence he continued to enjoy (Lond.
xxx. 17, LB. 706). About this time

he took part in de Keysere's second
attempt to found a university at
Tournay (Ep. 525 introd.); but the
project failed, and he resumed his
work at Antwerp. In Aug. 1528 116
left it (Baslc MS. Goclenii Epist„ f. 28
v0) definitely to join the Reformers;
and, though a priest, married. He
settled at Bremen till 1536, when he
was invited to Denmark. On 29 J uly
1540 he was appointed Rector of the
school at Wesel (cf. ME. 1924). Later,
23 June 1543, he was made Superin-
tendent of Wesel; but in 1548, refus-
ing to submit to the Interim, 116 with-
drew to Bremen. At his death he
was pastor of Blankenburg in the
Harz.

where, however, Lond. xx. 40, LB. 644

error vitiates also Kalkoff's ingenious
identification of Nicholas with the
author of the Vita S. Nicozai (Zw. E2..
pp. 401-20), who must be Corn. Gra-
phcus ; but the suggestion (ibid.) that
he may be identified with Nic. Quadus
Saxo (Bocking, pars prior, pp. 104-6) is
more probable.
