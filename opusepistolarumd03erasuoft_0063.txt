FROM ULRICH VON HUTTEN 27

scriba, qui nauiganti ex Britannia. tibi adfuit: qui nescis, Erasme, 25

quanti te faciant.

Mihi quidem, quod te nossem, quod praeceptorem
appellarem, miris modis benigni fuerunt.

Preter hos Antimachus

in Graecis professor citra honoris praefationem nunquam te nominat.
Paucos ibi dies commoratus sum, Venetias ad se vocantibus

duobus Huttenis qui in Syriam abeunt.

Huttenum excepit Baptista Egnatius et munus dedit hospitale,
Horatium Flaccum in tenuissimis membranis elegantissime expres-
sum. Accurrerunt statim Aloisius Bragadenus, Hermolaus Barbarus,
illius magni nepos, et Angelus Conterrenus, nobiles patriciis familiis

iuuenes.

Hi me omnes complexi sunt, omnes exosculati, cumque 35

tota passim vrbe medium circumduxissent ac honorifice suis ciuibus
ostendissent, tandem veluti Vlyssem aliquem in Alcynoi domum, id

est ad Asulani aedes, produxerunt.

Vbi senex ille obuiam mihi

progressus humanissime ad se accepit primum; post iussit prodire

his iuuenem quemdam Graece et Latine eruditum, quo in trans-

land in July 1516, and returned in
August ; see Brewer ii. 2117, 2149, and

. 1472.
p 27. Antimachus] Marc. Antonius, son
of Matthew Antimachus, a wealthy
citizen of Mantua, w-ho had been a
pupil of Greg. Tifernas († c. 1466).
Antonius spent five years in Greece
studying under J 0. Moschus of Sparta7
perhaps at Corcyra; but 011 Moschus’
death, fearing to venture the voyage
to Const. Lascaris in Sicily, he returned
to Venice, c. 8 Oct. (ἶ) 1499). By 1502
he had settled at Ferrara, whence on
15 July he dedicated to his father a
translation from Gemistus Pletho.
The inscription on his tomb, erected
by his son 5 Jan. 1552, states that he
taught Greek at Ferrara publicly for
20 years. In March 1540 he published
some translations from Pletho, Dion.
Halic., Dem. Phalereus, and Polyaenus
(Basle, R. Winter). When Oporinus'
edition of the Sibylline Books appeared,
Basle, March 1545, Antimachus col·
lated it with a MS. in his own posses-
sion, and contributed a prefaee in
Greek which was printed in Oporinus'
second* edition, Aug. 1555. See the
early preface to Pleth03 also Mazzu-
chelli and Legrand.

3ο. duobus Huttenis] of the Stolzen-
berg branch, Frowin († J an. 1529), the
accepted head of the Hutten family,
Marshal and later Steward of the
household of the Abp. of Mainz3 and

his young cousin Louis († 1532). See
Ersch and Gruber, Allq. Encycl. ii. xii.
221, 2. They made the pilgrimage to
Jerusalem in the party led by Bernard
of Hirschfeld, chamberlain of Duke
Frederick of Saxony (cf. SE. 119, 121);
sailing from Venice on 17 June, and
landing again at Gallipoli in Apulia
on 28 Oct. See Robricht, Deutsclze

pp. 208-11, and for the narrative of
the pilgrimage, Mitt. d. deutschen Gesell-
schaft‚ Leipzig, i. (1856), 31—1063 cf. HE.
55. Frowin had given much assistance
to Ulrich in his youth (HE. 22, 34).

32. Horatium] Venice, Aldus,
March 1509.

33. Bragadenus] Four persons of
this name are mentioned in Sanuto 58
(1533). One was Podesta of 'Proviso
1525-7 ; Sanuto 38, 43.

Barbarus] grandson of Zacharias,
who was the elder Hermolaus‘ father.
His name occurs frequently in
Sanuto. In 1554 he was a member
of the Council of Ten (Brown v. 847,
848 and 899).

34. Conterrenus] Perhaps Card.
Gasparo Contarini's (1483-1542) na-
tural brother, Angelo, who in 1541 had.
been twenty-three years in Turkey,
and was trying to remove his property
out of Turkish hands See F. Dittrich's

p. 167, and Life, 1885, p. 776.
