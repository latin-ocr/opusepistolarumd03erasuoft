Louvain.
17 October (1518).

[Henry Beyming or Beymigk of Butzbach, s. of Giessen, matriculated at
Erfurt in the summer of 1502. In 1509 he appears in the registers as received
from Mainz with a B.A. degree; but in the winter he migrated to Wittenberg.
In 1518 he was once more at Erfurt, but later retired to Butzbach to become
schoolmaster. Throughout the religious differ-ences which followed, he adhered
to the Papaoy, and at his death was parish priest of a village near Mainz. See
G. Bauch, Die Univ. Effurt, pp. 162‚3. His style is praised in EHE. p. 293]

872. 22. Eccio] Before 24 March 1518
he had composed some Obelisci criti-
cizing 18 of Luther’s theses; to
which Luther replied with Astem'sci
(LE2. 69, 83). Both were circulated
in ms„ and only appeared for the
first time in print in the Wittenberg
edition of Luther's works, 1545—58,
i. ff. 145 v0—158.

24. quid non] Cf. Verg. Aen. 3. 56,7.

26. nomisma] Evidently the thaler
struck by Duke Frederick of Saxony
in 1518, with his effigy and the title
of Lieutenant-General of the Empire :
see W. C. Hazlitt, Corinaye of the European
Continent, suppl. 1897, p. 148.

Suetonium] See Ep. 586.

873. 5. Vuindshemium] J od. 'textoris
of Windsheim in Middle Franconia,
between Wiirzburg and Anspach. From
1514 onwards he was teaching at Er-
furt, where Werter (p. 412) was one of
his pupils. He published orations on
the Passion, 1514, on humility, de-
livered 20 Dec. <1515 ⁴?>3 and on the
Law College, 19 May 151 7. He probably
was the author of three works on
confession, published by M. Maler at -
Erfurt, each of which contains Canta-
licius' Christiani poenitentis consessio:
Proctor 11250, Panzer vi. 498. 34,
Proctor 1r243. They show a gradual
evolution and increase, and Textoris'
name occurs in the two last. The
