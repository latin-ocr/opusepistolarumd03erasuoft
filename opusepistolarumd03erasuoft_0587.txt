[Epp. 940‹2 are clearly subsequent in date to Eobanus’ visit to Louvain in
Oet. 1518 (p. 405), which first brought Erasmus into touch with the Erfurt
circ-le ; and as they are printed in E, 1519 is the only year possible.

Euricius Cordus (Hem-y Solde) of Simtshausen in Upper Hesse (1486 — Dec.
1535) was apeasant’s son. He was educated first at Frankenberg and then at
Marburg till autumn 15053 when he matriculated at Erfurt (ΒΑ. 1507). After
marrying in 1508 lie left Erfurt, but returned in 1513. Next year he made
a fruitless attempt to find a position in Leipzig, lecturing on Vergil⁷s Bucolics.
In 1516 he proceeded M.A. at Erfurt, and in 1517 published a volume of
Epiymmmaza, Erfurt, M. Maler; ainplified in 1520 and 1529, and containing
many addressed to or concerning Erasmus. Not long afterwards he was
appointed rector of the school at St. Mary's in Erfurt3 cf. l. 13. Failing of
prosperity as a teacher, he went to Ferrara to study medicine under Nic.
Leonicenus. and met also C. calcagninus (Ep. 611. 24 n.) and Manardus. He
became MD. 1521 and then returned to Ger-many.

By that time, like others of his friends at Erfurt (pp. 407, 413, 602), he had left
his early admiration for Erasmus, and was attached to Luther ; whom he defended
with a pamphlet, 1522. He was town-physician of Brunswick 1523—7, and then
went to the newly founded University of Mar-burg as Professor of Medicine,
interesting himself also in Botany; see his Botanozoqicon, Cologne, J. Gymnich‚
1534. About Easter 1534 he went to Bremen as town-physician‚ but died there
before long.

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS EVRICIO CORDO LVDIMAGISTRO S. P.

V'r1NAM tam facile liceat omnibus mutuis literis vt amore mutuo
respondere! non committerem vt quoquam in officio viderer in-
ferior. Nunc quando vnus a tam multis lacessor, cogor in altero
cedere3 praesertim cum praeter vicissitudines literarum, quae mihi
non minimam temporis adimunt portionem, et tot alioqui studiorum 5
laboribus degrauer: ne quid imputem interim quod operae refellendis
obtrectatorum calumniis datur. An aliquos, vt scribis, Christo lucri-
fecerim neseio, quanquam a multis hoc nomine mihi aguntur gratiae ;
certe conatus sum, atque vtinam meipsum Christo lucrifecisseml
Etiam atque etiam nostrae gratulor Germaniae, quam video indies 10
magis ac magis melioribus literis mansuescere ac syluestre ingenium
exuere.

Quod Erfordiae ludum literarium aperis, vt felix faustumque sit
