[By this time Erasmus was in direct communication with Bohemia. In the
Apologia which he prefixed to the new edition of the New Testament, March
1519, p. 82, speaking of the wide recognition his work was receiving, he says :
‘Agnoscit Hrmgaria, agnoscit Bohemia, episcoporum ac summatium virorum
literis mihi gratias agens '. As part of the introductory matter which was still
unfinished in Oct. 1518 (p. 387), the Apologia may be dated about the end of the
year. See also Epp. 889. 14, 894. 6.

John Slechta († 1522) of Wyssehrd, Ε. of Prague‚ after education at Prague
University (B.A. 20 Sept. 1483, Μ.Α. 1484), was for sixteen years (1. 5) a
secretary in the service of Ladislas, King of Bohemia and Hungary (l. 5 n.),

and in that capacity was instrumental in bringing Balbus (Ep. 23. 47 n.) to teach
at Prague c. 1499—a step which, in view of Balbus' bad life, he afterwards

regretted. He was strongly interested in humanistic studies, and 0. 1500 com-
posed a dialogue on the relation of body and soul, Microcosmus, which on 3ο April
1522 110 dedicated to Stanislas Turzo, Bp. of Olmutz: but Ι cannot find that it
was actually printed. About 1507 110 retired from the perturbations of the
Court and settled at Kosteletz on the Elbe‚ ΝΕ. of Prague, where he occupied
himself in the education of his son, and in the management of his estates there
and at Kaurim, to the SE. The tone of his thoughts in later years was grave and
serious. His letters of that period include a disquisition on the vices of a celibate
clergy and an exhortation to the duties of a pai-ish priest ; and it was in the
same spirit that he addressed Erasmus, perhaps with some idea (cf. 11. 4 5-7) of
vindicating his country from the rather contemptuous reference to it in Ep.

54194bb21'it forty letters have been preserved of his correspondence ; some in the

MS. Lat. 2758 of the Prague Public Library, but mostly in the Lucubrationes of his

intimate friend, Bohuslaus Hassensteyn († 13 Nov. 1510), Prague, 1563 and 1570.
They have been arranged and edited by J. Truhlar in the Sln'rka Pramemiv ku

Pozndm' Litera'rniho Z⁹ivota‚ Prague, 1893 and 1897 (Boh. E ¹2 2). See also Monumenta
hist. Vniuers. Prayen. ii (1832), pp. 150-1‚ 153—43 where he appears as John of

Blewitz (near Sehlan, nw. of Prague) ‘ Sslechta cognominatus ’.

Slechta’s answer to this letter, dated 10 Oct. from Kosteletz (Lond. xiv. 2ο,
LB. 463), shows that Jonas (Ep. 963. 1 n.) was the bearer of this letter, and that
it was not delivered till 11 Sept]

Accam panegyricum tuum verius quam epistolam, quae tanto
ingenio tantaque facundia meas laudes decantat, vt magis illustret
encomiasten quam me qui laudor. Gaudeo nusquam gentium non
esse qui faueant melioribus literis, nec faueant modo verumetiam
colant. Porro sedecim illos annos quos in aula Ladislai Hungariae 5
Bohemiaeque regis contriuisti‚ non tibi prorsus perisse vel hae
tuae literae satis declarant. Caeterum ex omnibus laudibus quas tu
aceruatim effundis in me, nihil agnosco praeter animum iuuandi
mores Christianos et recta studia cupidum. Est voluptati mihi si
cui bono fuerunt meae vigiliae. Quorundam odia non queo satis 10
admirari, cum hactenus meis scriptis nemo factus sit vel vno pilo
