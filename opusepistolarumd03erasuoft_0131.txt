[Contemporary with Ep. 669.

John Briard (†8 Jan. 1520) usually known as Atensis, was born at Beloeil in
the district of Ath. He was educated at Louvain, where he was a member
of the Council 1 Oct. 1492 ; D.D. 11 Feb. 1500 ; Rector 111 Aug. 1505 and 1510 ; in
1506 professor of theology and Canon of St. Peter's church ; and 0. 1507 until his
death Vice-chancellor (cf. Ep. 643. 8 n.) in succession to Adrian of Utrecht. Some
quaestiones Quotzibeticaae disputed by him at Louvain, 1508-10, were included in
the second edition of Adrian's Quaesstones, Louvain, Th. Martens, Aug. 1518.
Nicholas of Hertogenbosch's edition of Hugo of St. Victor (p. 34), Dorp’s sermon
on the Assumption, Louvain, Th. Mal-tens, 18 Feb. 1514 (cf. Ep. 304 introd.),
and Vives' Genethliacon Iesu Christi, 1 J an. (1519), are dedicated to him. He was
a member of the council of Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy (†1503),
who in her later years resided at Mechlin.

As leader of the theological faculty in the university, though moderate, he was
necessarily conservative, and was inclined to be afraid of Erasmus’ advanced
views. But on the whole their relations were cordial, aud even really friendly
(cf. Ep. 867. 255) ; and Erasmus often appeals to his authority (cf. Ep. 669. 6, 7)
in later years, as having approved of his edition of the New Testament (Lond. i.
2, xix. 112, 106, 91 ; LB. 587, 629, 741, 746 : also Apol. qua respondet, f0. B 3 Jortin ii.
500). The only breach between them was 0. Feb. 1519, when Briard in confer-
ring a degree was thought to have referred with censure to Erasmus’ recently
published Encomium Matrimonii (Ep. 604. 10 n.). As he hastened to withdraw
(cf. Apol. adu. Satoris debacchationem, LB. ix. 770 Β), Erasmus contented himself
with replying publicly in a short and unusually restrained Apoloyia, dated 1 March
1519, and published by Froben in May; see also p. 480. And there the matter
ended3 though in 1523 Erasmus still could not speak of it without bitterness
(1. pp. 22. 30—23. 83. See BN. and de J ongh pp. 149-51.]
