iv PREFACE

in Holland to Dr. Molhuysen‚ Dr. Muller and Dr. van Rijn3

in Italy to Dr. Brom of the Dutch Historical School at Rome,
and to Count Ugo Balzani;

in Spain to Sr. Menendez y Pelayo (†) and Professor Bonilla
y San Martin:

in Switzerland to Dr. Bernoulli and Dr. Schiess3

in America to Professor J. L. Gerig of Columbia University
and Professor Preserved Smith of Amherst3

and in this country to Mr. Loveday of Williamscote‚ Dr. See-
bohm (†)‚ and Professor W. H. Woodward.

The three whom we mourn as dead need no memorial here:
their names are known far and wide. M. Vander Haeghen as
a librarian and bibliographer, Dr. Seebohm as a historian and
owner of books gave prompt help and encouragement to this
work at its first beginning, nearly twenty years ago. I delight
to count them as masters and to remember how much I have
owed to them at every stage. Of him whom his countrymen
affectionately call ‘Don Mareelino’ I cannot even say ‘Vidi
tantum'; but the fragrance of the welcome extended by his
letters, written in illness‚ will not fade. I should like to be
able to render to this trio of famous scholars the tribute they
would most have valued‚ of handing on to those that come
after the spirit of high endeavour and ample generosity that
characterized all their work.

With this volume we are practically finished with the two
Deventer manuscripts Ten years have elapsed‚ almost to the
day, since they first entered the Bodleian : and they are now on
the point of returning to their northern Athenaeum. All scholars
know how great is the advantage of having originals at hand,
when printing: but only we who have turned to these manu-
scripts again and again can be conscious of the numerous
occasions on which their presence here has made it possible
to advance nearer to the standards of accurate reproduction
which such work as this requires. Our most grateful thanks
are due to Dr. van Slee and the Curators of the Deventer
Library for the far-sighted patience with which they have
acquiesced in this long delay. The assistance they have
rendered us is incomparable.

P. S. ALLEN.
