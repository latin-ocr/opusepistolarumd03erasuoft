610, FROM JOHN CAESARms.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 119. Cologne.
LB. App. 152. 20 July <1517 ‘?>.

[It is not easy to determine the year-date. The general resemblance to
Ep. 442 suggests 1516 3 with the interpretation that Erasmus had sent to
Caesarius a manuscript copy of his preface to Gaza, accompanied by a letter in
which he asked for advice as to where to print it. Ep. 428 might well have
reached Cologne about 1 July (Ep. 442. 1); and this date would also make it
possible to identify ⁴ Iacobus adolescens studiosissimus ’ (l. 48) with James
Nepos, who entered Erasmus' service about this time (cf. Ep. 595. 11 n.).

1 incline, however, to retain 1517, the date assigned by Leclere, and followed
by Dr. Reich and Mr. Nichols, though without reason given in any case. On
this view Caesarius 'is expressing his thanks, either for the dedication of book ii
of Gaza, which Erasmus translated about this time (cf. Ep. 771), and may have
promised already ; or, more probably, for some work on behalf of Reuchlin (cf. l.
24 n.) which Erasmus had long promised to write, but for which a suitable
motzf had only reeently occurred to him (11. 1-35. After his long experience of
Martens and Froben it seems hardly likely that Erasmus would have consulted
Caesarius as to a printer for Gaza 3 but for a composition which would involve
him as a partisan in the Reuchlin controversy he might well turn to a printer
recommended by Reuchlin's frIends. Other indicationsare that this is possibly
the letter referredsso in Epp. 615. 3, 622 ; the verbal resemblance noted in l. 31 ; and
the fact that this letter is copied in the Deventer Letter-book by Hand A in its
straight form, in which it also wrote the manuscript of Gaza, book ii, about this
time (cf. vol. i, p. 605). Also Ep. 622 supplies a more probable identification
of Iacobus (l. 48 n.)‚ since Te-yng was certainly ‘conterraneus’ to Erasmus]
