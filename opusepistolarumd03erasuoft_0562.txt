508 LETTERS or ERAsMUs [1519

1 March, when the Apology for the De laude matrimonii was completed. But he
perhaps went shortly afterwards to Mechlin 3 for the word retulerim (1. 3) suggests
a return after being sent back to Louvain to negotiate with Croy. He probably
did not stay at Mechlin long after 21 March 3 for by 28 March he had finished
the Apology against Latomus (Ep. 934. 3 n.)‚ which was a work of two or three
davs (Epp. 948. 42, 952. 19‚20), and was presumably written at Louvain. A few
days latei· he went off hurriedly to Antwerp ; see Ep. 934. 8 n.

John Louis Vives (6 March 1492-6 May 1540) wasayoung Spaniard who was
just beginning to make a reputation. After education in Valencia, his native
town, he came to France c. 1509-10, probably to Paris, where for some years he
studied in the University; also visiting Bruges 0. 1512. His first published
work is an edition of Hyginus, Paris, J. Lambert, s. a., with a letter dated
31 March 1514, stating that he was about to lecture on it ; and a short biographi-
031 notice of his teacher, John Dullardus of Ghent (†10 Sept. 1513), printed in 311
edition of Dullardus’ commentary on Aristotle’s Metheora, Paris, T. Kees‚ 30 May
1 514. To this period also belongs his Christi Iesu Triumphus, dedicated from Paris,
April 1514, to Bernard de Mesa, who in Jan. 1517 became Bp. of Elna (GC. vi.
1066). Vives returned to the Netherlands, probably to Bruges, and in 1516-7
made the acquaintance of Erasmus at Brussels (Apol. qua respondet, f0. Α8 ; J ortin
ii. 497). Later he went to England in search of employment (Ep. 545. 15), but
without success ; and in 1518 he appears as tutor to William Croy (p. 68) at
Louvain, and on terms of intimacy with Erasmus (Apol. qua respondet, ff. Β, 03 v0. z
Jortin ii. 500, 507). 111 <1519> Martens printed for him a volume of opuscula
varia, containing the Christi Triumphus and many slight compositions addressed
to Croy and other patrous (cf. p. 93). On 3 March 1520 he received licence to
teach privately in the University (de J ongh, p. 20³³). After Croy's death Vives
remained at Louvain, and, as a part of the collected edition of Augustine’s works
projected by Erasmus (cf. Ep. 844. 255 n.)‚ completed the De Ciuitate Dei, Basle,
Froben, Sept. 1522, with a dedication to Henry vn1. Equipped with this 110
visited England in the autumn, again without the success he wished ; though
Henry acknowledged the dedication with a letter, 24 J an. 1523.

On the death of Ant. Nebrissensis (Ep. 487. 14 n.) an invitation came to Vives
to fill his chair at the University of Alcala3 sent through John Vergara, 6 Sept.
1522, from Valladolid <Reme Hispanique viii, 1901, pp. 247, 260). 111 May 1523
therefore he determined to revisit Spain3 but, taking England on his way, he
attractedthe notice of Wolsey‚ who sent him to teach at Oxford. He was
lodged in Foxe's college of Corpus Christi, and was incorporated in the Univer-
sity, 10 Oct. 1523. In April 1524 110 returned to Bruges and married, 26 May ;
but in the winter of 1524-5 he was again lecturing at Oxford. Till 1528 he was
at intervals in England, mostly at the Gourt, where he taught the Princess
Mary; but for supporting the Queen about the Divorce he fell into disfavour,
and was even for 3 time under restraint. Being driven from England he settled
at Bruges, and there most of his remaining years were spent 3 one of his visitors,
in 1529, being Ignatius Loyola. It was his most fruitful literary period 3 and
in it he produced a number of works on educational, political, socia] and
religious questions, which have not received from posterity their due of recogni—
tion. Vives is eminent among the humanists for the importance that he attached
to Aristotle3 and, like Erasmus, he frequently raised his voice on behalf of
international peace.

Of his letters 18 to Erasmus and two others were first printed, presumably
from the originals, in vol. ii of the collected edition of his works, Basle, Nic.
Episcopius, Aug. 1555 ; and 39 to various friends appeared in 1556, Antwerp,
G. Simon, probably from the rough drafts (Vi. E). There are two original
letters to him of<1524 ‘?> and (1533) in the Town Library at Breslau (Cod. Rehd.
243, ff. 148, 138] : see also Al. E. 56 3 Goldast, Ceut. Epist. Philot, 1610, nos. 51,2;
and Revue Hispanique viii, 1901, pp. 261, 267. Gourmont's edition of Barland's

Collectanea (p. 63) contains a letter of Vives to Barland written from Louvain .

(1⁷⁰. g⁵); but it does not seem possible to assign 3 date.
