Litterae secundo careant lectore, verum Vulcano operosissimo
tradantur deo. Innumeri egri laborantes ventris fluore ac aliis
morbis acutissimis mihi impedimento sunt vt litteras rescribere
nequeo ; testis erit mihi lator praesentis, tuus puer.

10. CESAREVS ERASMO SVO S.

MAGISTER Georgius, conterraneus tuus, optimus praeterea vir, breui
ad te venturus est. Iam Phrisiam adiit, dehinc Brabanthzm,
Hollandiam. Huic ad te litteras dedi his paulo pleniores. Martinus
Groningus patria, alioqui Bremensis, his diebus ad nos ex Vrbe
rediit. Is est qui in causa Capnionis non parum multum sollicitus
fuit, vna cum doctore Ioanne Vander Wick. Idem Martinus Oculare
Speculum iussu Pontificis transtulit e vulgari in Latinum sermonem.
Ex hoc percunctatus quonam pacto res Capnionis tractaretur, accepi
optime, et per hoc amicis quidem gaude<n>dum esse, aduersariis autem
dolendum. Nec fere abest, quoniam Hogestratus nuper reuersus
cum suis vel prorsus omni exuti sunt leticia vel eam dissimulant

Martinus] Gruningk († 1521) of
the diocese of Bremen, who matri—
culated in 1511 at Bologna (ANGB. p.
273& and became LL.D. of Siena ; and
subsequently was canon and c. 1514—6
cantor of the cathedral at Bremen.
Since Jan. 1515 (RE. 201) he had been
engaged as a lawyer in Reuchlin’s
cause at Rome; but had recently re-
turned thence, bringing with him
Geo. Benignus' Defensio Reuchlini (Ep.
680. 26 n.)‚which he sent to Maximilian
with a letter dated Cologne, 1 Aug.
1517. In 1515 (RE. 206Χ4 he translated
the Auqenspieyel (Ep. 290. 1 n.) into
Latin, by commission from the Pope;
but although his version was in circu·
lation early in 1516 (MHE. iv. 19, 20),
1 cannot find that it was ever printed.

About 1521 he procured from Norway
a MS, of some lost books of Livy, and
offered it to Leo x ς but by the time an
answer came from Rome, he was dead,
and the MS. disappeared. Herm. of
Neuenahr. writing in 1517, speaks of
ancient friendship with him. perhaps
formed at Bologna. See MHE. iv. 25,
B'ocking and ADB.

4. his diebus] Cf. RE. 244.

6. Vander Wick] of Miinster is only
known at two periods of his life.
From 1515-ss he was Reuchlin's chief
agent in the process at Rome (RE. 201,
271). In 1528 he was Syndic of
Bremen, and played a leading part on
the Evangelical side, both there and at
Minister, especially in connexion with
the League of Schmalkalden. In April
1534 he was seized by the Bp. of
Miinster and put to death in prison.
