84 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 7

661,45 FROM ALBERT or BRANDENBURG.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 223. Steinheim.
LB. 334. 13 September 1517.

[The earliest source is the Deventer manuscript, where the copyist is Hand B
(αἱ), corrected by another contemporary hand (αἳ). It was subsequently printed
in the separate editions of the Ratio Verae Theoloqiae 3 see Ep. 745, where the sigla
are given. The two letters are copied also (ΒΞ) 111 Martin Lypsius' volume at'
Brussels (MS. 4850-7 ; cf. Epp. 296 and 304) 3 but an examination of the variants
shows that, apart from sporadic errorS, Lypsius had Bl as his original.

In the printed editions the date is given as 1518; being made to conform with
the new date assigned there to Ep. 745 also. In support of the manuscript date
there are many considerations ε the absence of any mention in the MS. of
Albert‘s cardinalate (cf. Ep. 745. 22 n. and 39 n.); the limits of Hand B,
22 April — 7 Oct. 1517 (see App. 8) ; the connexion of Ep. 662 with Epp. 614 and
631 3 and the references to this letter in Epp. 662, 695, 732, 756, 759, 761, 763, 783,
794, 809, where the stress laid on its being written by Albert himself removes
any doubt as to identification 3 and finally the mention in HE. 75 ξ 24, where it
must be the letter intended, although it does not contain all the sentiments
enumerated. It is noticeable that in Epp. 695 and 756 the mention of this letter
is omitted in printing ; but in view of the publication of Epp. 759, 761, 794, 809
in the same volume, the fact appears to have no significance.

Albert (28 June 1490 — 24 Sept. 1545), Max-grave of Brandenburg, was at this
time a patron of art and letters from whom much was expected (cf. HE. 75
ξς 24-6). After education at the university of Frankfort-on-the-Oder, which he
and his brother had founded in 1506, he entered the Church‚ and quickly became
canon of Mainz and of Treves. In Aug. and Sept. 1513 he received the sees of'
Magdeburg and Halberstadt‚ and on 9 March 1514 was elected Abp. of Mainz 3
where he attracted to his court men like Stromer, Hutten, and Capito. But his
position as Elector drew him into politics ; and, his connexion with Tetzel
attracting the hostility of the Reformers, he gradually became one of the
staunchest bulwarks of Catholicism. Sec ADB. i. 268-7o.]
