20. Erasmu1n]Froben’s younger son,
born between 4 Nov. 1515 (cf. Q. p. 58)
and 28 Feb. 1516, if Erasmus is
accurate in saying (1. p. 9. 26) that he
was six when the Colloquiorum Fomnulae
(Basle, Froben, March 1522) were
dedicated 10 him. In a De Con-
structione (Ep. 341) printed for him by
his father at this time, and in an
Alphabetu‘m Graecum of March 1518, his
name appears as John Erasmus
Froben; but by 1522 the form
Erasmius had been adopted (cf. 1v.
546 11.). His godfathers were Erasmus
and Beatus Rhenanus3 and at his
confirmation, before March 1522,
Capito was his sponsor. The Basle
Library has a copy of Froben’s edition
of the Colloq. Formulae, (c. Aug.) 1522,
printed for him on vellum (AN. VI. 4).
For another Froben edition, Aug. 1524,
Erasmus remedelled the preface. In
June 1522 the boy was sent to Freiburg
to be taught by Heresbach (Basle MS. G.
ΙΙ. 29: letters of Froben to Bon. Amer-
bach (24 June ‘?> and 6 July 1522; cf.
Lond. xx. 38, LB. 636). In March 1527
he was at school under L. Carinus at
Coblenz (Lond. xxi. 53, LB. 853: and
Jortin ii. 456) ; and a dispute over the
manner of his education was one of
the causes of Erasmus' quai-rel with

8. Calend. Septemb. Α11.Μ.1). 17.

Carinus (Th. v. Liebenau in ΚαίῙι.
3611α·εεέεγ-Βί(.“ὶΐεεν, ΝΡ. 11. 1886, p. 344).
After Froben’s death Erasmus felt
responsibility for his godson (Lond.
xxviii. 1, LB. 1084, 125111), and had
him at Freiburg in the autumn of
1529. In Oct. the boy’s guardians
recalled him 1ο go to Paris (Basle MS.
D. IV. 18. 309 v0, 311 v⁰); but were
persuaded to send him to Groclen at
Louvain (Lond. xxvi. 51, LB. 1079:
Q. pp, 59-61). He was there in Aug.
1530, but in Nov. 1531 was at Lille,
learning French (Basle MS. Goclenii
Epist. ff. 6, 9) ; Erasmus' offer to take
the boy for the summer of 1531, and
advice to make him a scriniarius
(Horawitz ii. 9) being both declined.
By Nov. 1534 he had returned to Basle
(Basle MS. D. IV. 18. 444 ; cf. Q. p. 45).
On 23 Aug. 1536 (BRE. 296, 300) he
married Katharine Weckhart; and
then joined his stepfather, John
Herwagen, in the printing business,
vols. 3 and 4 of the Basle Galen, 1538,
and the Paroemiae of Apostolius, 1538,
being from their press. In Jan. 1542
lie divorced his wife for adultery with
Hei-wagen3 and by Feb. 1545 appears
to have married again. See Heitz and
Bernoulli, Basler Biichermarken‚ 1895,
pp. xx, xxvii, xxx.
