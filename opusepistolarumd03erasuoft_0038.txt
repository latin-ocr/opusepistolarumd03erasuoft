Ep. 628]

QVOD me vno neglecto ad ceteros amicos scribis, admodum dolenter
ferrem, nisi, vt est in adagio, mihi ipsi ταύτην ἀμνηστίαν meopte
iumento aduexissem, qui adhuc domi tanquam claudus sutor desideam‚
cum me ad proximum Pasca Romam petiturum scripserim. Caue

5 hanc moram desidie ascripseris.
