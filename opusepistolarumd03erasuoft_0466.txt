qui clamitent me nec sapere nec fari, ex meis libellis pestem hauriri
pietatis. Quot conuiciis fratrum ac theologorum lapidatum est
Nouum Testamentum! sed hactenus in absentem omnia, coram
nemo verbum. Quod vos tribuitis non agnosco, quod illi impingunt

per gloriam et ignominiam, per infamiam et bonam famam, pro
nostra virili ad Christi scopum eniti. Dabis veniam breuitati
nostrae. Scribo haec cum valetudinarius, tum plus quam obrutus
scribendi labore. Bene vale Louanii. xiiii. Cal. Nouembr.

felt that the praise lavished elsewhere on
other German scholars was too indis-

was under Geo. Simler3 probably at
Pforzheim, where Simler was head of
the Latin school until 1510. On 16 May
1516 he matriculated at Tubingen, and
was a pupil of Melanchth on (Germ. Exey.
ii. 41), who was his junior. In 1518
he was Moderator of St. Katherine's
College at Heidelberg, and in 1519
a member of the University Council.
In 1524 he became parish priest of
Ettlingen; but had to resign in 1531
for Lutheranism. From 1532 until his
death he was parish priest of Grem-
mingen, SE. of Heidelberg3 and helped
to found a Latin school there.

on Horace A. P. were printed by one of
his sons in 1567. See ADB. xiv. 582-3.

4. Maguntiae] Evidently on Eras-
mus' journey to Basle.

5. Gnostopolitanus] John Cellarius
(1496 — 21 Apr. 1542) of Burgkund—
stadt, 20 miles Nw. of Baireuth. He
was perhaps a pupil of Codrus Urceus
at Bologna. After teaching Hebrew at
Liege (?: cf. Ep. 674. 29 11.), Louvain
and Mainz, he visited Reuchlin at Zell
in Baden, June 1518 (RE. 261 = MRE’.
578). On 24 J an. 1519 he matriculated
at Heidelberg, being already M.A. In
May he passed through Wittenberg on
