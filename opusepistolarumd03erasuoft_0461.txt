12. Egranus] John Wildenauer (Syl-
vius) onger in nw. Bohemia (†1 1 June
1535). He matriculated at Leipzig at
Easter 1500 and was Β.Α. 1501, Μ.Α.
1507. In 1508-9 he contributed verses
and prefaces to several books printed at
Leipzig; and two books of later date
are dedicated to him. On 1 Aug. 1516,
being probably already preacher at
Zwickau, he wrote thence to Boniface
Amerbach, lauding Erasmus (Basle
MS. G. II. 26. 214). Ι11 1517 he re-
jected in a sermon the received opinion
that st. Anne had married Cleophas
after the death of Joachim ς and being
attacked by the orthodox‚ defended
himself with an Apoloyia (Nuremberg,
F. Peyp) 1518 (Proctor 11126): the
British Museum copy of which (3905.
f. 20) had reached Wittenberg by
19 Feb. 1518. The doctrine was main-
tained by Com-,Wimpina (cf. the life
by J. Negwer, 1909, pp. 132-6, 220)
and Jerome Dunghersheym (Ep. 554
introd.); to whom he replied with
an Apozoqetz'ca Responsio, Wittenberg,
(a. Aug.) 1518, which received the
support of both Luther and Erasmus
(LE2. 55, 69, 74, 92: cf. 171). The
town-council of Zwickau sided with
him and tried to persuade him to settle ;
but from a visit to Nuremberg, Basle
(British Museum Add. Ms. 21524‚ f. 5 ;
cf. A. Petri's preface to his edition of
Luther's Lucubrationes, J uly 1520, f0. d),
Schlettstadt, Strasburg (BRE. 176)
and Wittenberg in 1520 he returned to
find himself placed under a ban by Eck.
This and the hostilities of Miinzer
drove him from Zwickau, and in the
spring of 1521 he accepted an invita-
tion to become preacher at J oachim stal,
near Eger ; but after two years he re-
sumed his wandering life, visiting
Erasmus at Basle in July 1523 and
Pirckheimer at Nuremberg. In 1525
he was again at Zwickau, in 1526 at
Sagan in Silesia (to this period pro—
bably belongs an undated autograph
letter by him, fiercely condemning
Luther's De serim arbitrio: Basle MS.
(4². Ι. 20¹³, pt. 2. 1), 111 1531 at Merse-

burg (GHE. 293 cf. LE2. 2138 11.), 111
1533 again at J oachimstal ; where, after
a visit to Chemnitz in 1534, 110 died.

He was at first attracted to Luther ;
but his Apoloqia shows him in ardent
admiration of the genius of Erasmus,
and in this he continued throughout
his life. See Ο. Glemen in Mitt. d.
Altertumsvereinsfi Zwickau vi (1899) and
vii (1902) ; where the scandals imputed
to him in ADB are refuted. Erasmus’
memory was perhaps at fault when he
asserted in 1531 (Lond. xxvi. 45, LB.
1188) and again in 1534 (Zs. s. kirchliche
Wissenschast v, 1884, p. 56) that Egranus
accompanied Eobanus to Louvain on
this occasion. There is no indication
at this time of any other companion
than Werter (p. 412).

12. Eleutherium] Luther adopted
this form in 1517 : LE2. 50.

16. Syluestri] Silvester Mazolini (c.
1456 — 1523) of Priero in sn. Piedmont.
He entered the Dominican order at
Genoa 0. 1471, and was ordained priest
c. 1479. After teaching with great
success at Bologna 1499, and Padua
1501, 110 was elected Vicar-General of
the Dominicans for Lombardy in 1508.
In 1514 at the instance of Grimani
Leo x invited him to Rome to succeed
Schomberg as teacher of the theology
of Aquinas; and in 1515 he was made
Master of the Papal palace. His works,
which begin with a Compendium dim
lectiae, 1496, were in the main theo—
logical, Summae and commentaries on
the Sentences: but he also wrote on
the movements of the planets. About
1522-3 he was one of those who
sought to enlist Erasmus' support for
the Church against Luther (Lond. xx.
52, LB. 664). See Trith.³ f. 220, Quetif
and Echard, Script. Praed. ii. 55-8, and
a dissertation by F. Michalski‚ Miinster,
18 2.

{fter the publication of Luther’s
theses, 31 Oct. 1517, Silvester replied
on behalf of the Papacy with In pre-
su¹r›‘cptu0.‹3‹1.<›⁵ Martini Luther conclusiones (Ie
potestate Pape dialogus (c. Feb 1518); cf.
LE2. 65. 87.
