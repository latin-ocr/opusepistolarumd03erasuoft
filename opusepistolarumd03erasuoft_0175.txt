710] ΤΟ DOMENICO GRIMANI 137

translation 01· the Paraphrases into English3 the Gospel of St. John being en-
trusted to the Princess Mary. The book was printed in 1548 in two volumes,
and again in 1551—2 ; and some Inizmccions of Edward VI (London, R. Grafton,
31 July 1547, ff. a⁴v⁰‚ b⁴3 reprinted in E. Cal-dwell’s Documentary Amzals of the
rqformed Church of Enqland, 1844, i, pp. 9, 13) ordered that a copy of the Gospels
(perhaps the only part yet available) should be placed beside the Bible in
every parish church throughout the realxn, and that every parson below the
degree of B.D. should possess the book. Under Elizabeth the Injunctions were
renewed in 1559 with slight modifications; see H. Gee and W. J. Hardy‚
Documents illustram-e of Evnyzish Church history, 1896, pp. 421, 425. There is
some account of the English version of the Paraphrases 111 R. W. Dixon's
Hist. os the Church of Enqlami, ii. (1887), pp. 423—5.

This Paraphrase on the Romans was executed at Antwerp, probably in May
and June 1517 (Ep. 684. 133 cf. Lond. xxiii. 6, LB. 650, 764 Α). The printing
began in Oct. (Ep. 687. 15; cf. Ep. 732) and was nearly completed by 21 Nov.
(Ep. 719); and by 30 Nov. Erasmus had begun to distribute it to his friends
(Ep. 726). He had at one time thought of dedicating it to the Archbishop 01·
Mainz (Ep. 745) ; but the possibility that he might wish to go to Italy to print
the second edition of his New Testament (cf. Ep. 770 introd.) was perhaps
the motive which determined him to choose one 01· his old patrons (Ep. 334) :
to whom, however, a copy of the first edition, Louvain, Th. Martens, N ov. 1517
(a), was not sent (Ep. 835). Two years later Erasmus had received no acknow—
ledgement from Grimani (Lond. xiii. 7, LB. 462; cf. 1. p. 43. 17-20).

Froben's reprint 01· Jan. 1518 (β) has a different year-date for this preface3
but the new edition which Froben printed in Nov. 1518 (7) follows α closely, as
do also his 01· April 1519 and Jan. 1520. These are the last issues of this
Paraphrase singly or joined with one or two others. Afterwards the collected
volumes begin. In the first 01· these, Froben's two octavo editions of March
(δ) and July 1521, this preface shows signs 01· revision by Erasmus ; but the
changes which appear in the folio Froben edition of Feb. 1522 (ε) may be
regarded as mere inadvertences. Froben's next editions of May 1522 (ζ) and
1523, both octavo, and of 1523-4, folio, reproduce the text of δ. Of the
remaining editions published by the Froben firm, 1110511)γ 111 folio, that 01· 1532
(η) shows further slight changes by Erasmus, and the edition of 1534 follows
this3 but the posthumous volume 01· 1541 (θ) included in the collected Opera
must owe its trifling variations to the editors. See 1. pp. 20. 26-21. 10 and
