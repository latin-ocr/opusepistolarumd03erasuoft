appears to have stayed at- 133510, teach-
ing the young Amerbachs (Basle MS,
G. II. 13. 111) and probably also Capito
(Epp. 707, 731, 797 z cf. Ep. 459 introd.
Seb. Miinster's statement, 10 Dee. 1541,
in the preface to his Opus 9⁷·a7nmatz'cuvvz,
Basle, H. Petri, March 1542, that Capito
learnt from Adi-ian at Bruchsal 0. 1513,
seems doubtful). He next went to
Heidelberg, where he is said to have
taught Brenz, who matriculated 13 Oct.
1514 and was B.A. 20 May 1516, ancl
Oecolampadius3 see the latter's life by
Capito, f0. (4 in Oecolampaclii Epistolae,
Basle, T. Platter, March 1536.

After an interval he reappears at
Middelburg (Ep. 798. 17), perhaps
having returned from Spain, and in
the autumn of 1517 had come to
Louvain to teach Hebrew. But he
soon gave offenee (Epp. 798, 852, 877) ;
and although he was appointed to the
Hebrew chair in the Collegium trilin-
gue, an oration delivered on 21 March
1519 (afterwards printed by J. Grunen-
berg atWittenberg‚ 1520, with a 111-01300
to Spalatinus) so roused the theologians
that he decided to leave Louvain. In
N ov. 1519 he was in treaty withWitten-
berg (Ι..Ε.2 242, 243, 250) and by 17 April
1520 had been engaged by Duke Fred-
eriek (ME. 69) in default of Cellarius
(p. 414). Ηο matriculated 24 April;
but by the autumn he had fallen out
with Luther‚ and was negotiating to go
to Leipzig (ΙιΕ.2 350, 362). 111 the

spring 110 went (LE.'-' 399, ME. 104,
106), perhaps to Freiburg (cf. Schreiber.
Gesch.cl. Unio. Freibury, ii. 212 11.); but after
that he disappears.

Some of his Hebrew versions were
reprinted by Froben in an Introductco
to Hebrew grammar, 15 March 1518
and Feb. 1520. A much more ambitious
undertaking mentioned in Adrian's
letter to Aruorbach does not seem to
have been carried out. Erasmus quotes
him as an authority in the notes to the
New Testament, 1519, p. 498.

In 1513 Adrian was already a Dr. of
Medicine ; and Erasmus consulted him
111 his illness in 1518 (Ep. 867. 207).
