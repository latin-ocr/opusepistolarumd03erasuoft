Paschasius Berselius (†May fin. 1535), was born at Bierset, 5 miles West
of Liege. He is said to have made his profession at the Benedictine Abbey of
St. Laurence, Liege, 3 July 1502 ; but as he is styled iuuenis in 1519 (Ep. 926. 18).
the date seems doubt-ful. For some years he was resident in Liege, and enjoyed
the confidence of Bp. De la Marck (p. 167) ; but in the autumn of 1518 he visited
Louvain (Ep. 867. 256 ; cf. a preface dated 1518, Louvain‚ in Vives' opuscula

to Louvain to study Greek (Epp. 926. 928) : cf. a poem by Com-ad Goclen,
Lucubrationum Erasmicarum Elenchus. c. April 1519, added in Martens' edition of
