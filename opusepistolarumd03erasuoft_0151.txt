nondum a Moro recepi; velim cures vt mihi redeat, si modo potes.
Scripsi Badeo vt te moneret, curares Galenum a Linacro versum ad
me mittendum, non dono, sed ere meo redimendum. Vtinam huc
ad (nos) te conferas! Buslidius instituit Collegium, in quo erunt 10
tres egregii trium linguarum professores. Iam adest Hebreus ex-
quisite doctus, nomine Mattheus Bene vale, et parentibus tuis meo

691. To GILLES BUSLEIDEN.
Brussels MS. Louvain.

30 October (1517).

[There are two copies of this letter in the Royal Library at Brussels, Oarton
Pinchart, No. 193 one (al) of xviii⁰‚ corrected by a second hand (αἳ), the other
(β) by Pinchart (†1884)‚ who indicates his source as ‘Arch. du roy., Coll.
d‘autographes’. It is clear that the original was an autograph in the Royal
Archives, but it cannot now be found.

The contents of this letter and of Epp. 699, 804-5 may be elucidated by
consideration of J 'erome Busleiden's will. His wish was that the new foundation,
of three teachers and ten scholars, should be established as a college within one
of the existing cosseges, either St. Donatian's or the college of Arras. But the
authorities of those institutions refused to accept such an arrangement, and at
one time it seemed possible that the scheme might come to nothing ; especially
as the interests of the family were directly opposed. The executors decided.
however, to found a new college independently; on 1 Sept. 1518 the teachers
began to lecture officially in the Augustinian convent, though Matt. Adrian had
been teaching shortly after his appointment (Ep. 805) 3 and the college was
formally installed in its own buildings 18 Oct. 1520. See Neve pp. 47-56.

There is no difficulty in identifying the Medicus with Matthew Adrian (p. 108),
and thus the year-date may be assigned with certainty]

ERASMVS BVSLIDIO S. D.

Mnmcvs hic iamdudum heret, non sine magno suo dispendio, et
arte relicta et vxore, et instat hyems. Mihi negocium videtur
omnium esse pulcherrimum et immortalitate dignum ; sed plurimum
interest quibus auspiciis ineatur. Mea sententia non per vulgares
aut mediocres incipiendum est, sed per insignes et magni nominis 5
professores. Hic vnus contigit qualem nec ab Italia licebit accersere ;
proinde meo iudicio modis omnibus est alligandus. Id fiet si statim
illi designetur locus, et salarium decernatur ipso dignum. Pro
exordIO potius reliquis census adimendus ad tempus, dummodo pro-
fessio trium linguarum cum dignitate ac splendore instituatur. 10
