[The postscript to tho duplicate of Ep. 794 ; sec pp. 246, 7.]

M1s1 ante complures dies has litteras per Balbum puerum; verum
quoniam video quasdam non perferri, rursus easdem misi per alium.
Gratulor optimo patrono¹ meo Reuerendissimo P. Mai-liano, cui me
quantum potes commendabis; qui mei dignatus est meminisse in
litteris ad communem amicum Rimaclum: qui nuper me osculis5
pene enecauit, sed iam non admodum osculabilis, pessimo morbo

indigne affectus.

Faustus, poeta immortalis, tandem mortuus est

Lutetiae ς Romae M. Musurus Cretensis, homo doctus et iam episcopus
designatus; item Paleotus. Aiunt astrologi hoc anno tantam fore

pestilentiam vt nulli superstites futuri sint nisi probi viri, hoc est ιο

paucissimi. Tu tibi caue.

Si vera sunt quae audio de Decano Bizontino, vetere amico mec,
profecto est cur magnopere gaudeam.

12. Bizontino] John (1469—7 Feb.
1544 2²), second son of John Carondelet,
a former Chancellor of Burgundy
(†1501). In 1497 he was a master of
requests in the household of the Arch-
duke Philip, and in 1504 a member of
his Council. In 1515 he was appointed
to Charles' Council, and in 1517 went
with him to Spain ; where on the death
of Le Sauvage he acted temporarily
as Chancellor of Castile (Brewer ii.
4219, 4228). On returning in 1519 he
rapidly rose to great power and influ-
ence as Councillor to Margaret of
Austria,whose confidence, and Charles',

amam< 111

he completely enjoyed. In 1493 (Du-
nod, Hist. de Z'e'ylz'se cle Besanqon, i, p. 379)
he had been created Dean of Besancon ;
and besides monastic preferment he
received in 1520 the Provostship of
St. Donatian’s at Bruges, and at length
the abpric. of Palm-mo, which Charles
had vainly conferred upon him at
this time <Brewer ii. 4218). His power
culminated in the presidency of the
Privy Council of the Netherlands.
which he held 1531—40. By his will
he became the second founder of the
college of St. Donatian at Louvain.
Erasmus found him a patron 011
whom he could rely, and writes to him
frequently about his pay as Councillor
and the question of his return to the
Netherlauds, which Carondelet was
anxious to promote. His edition of
Hikrry, Basle‚ Froben, Feb. 1523, is
dedicated to Carondelet.

vetere amico] Perhaps a mistake.
