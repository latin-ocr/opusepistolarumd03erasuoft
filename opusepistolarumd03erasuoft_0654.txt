600 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1519

praesertim in tanto amico. Mitto Paraphrasin in Epistolam ad
Galatas, in qua locus est de Petro Pauli voce obiurgato‚ qui mihi
nondum satis a quoquam veterum explicatus videtur. Non sum
ignarus varios rumores de me spargi. Sentiunt philobarbari erigere
sese recta studia, eoque nullum non mouent lapidem3 sed temporis
progressu vincet veritas. Hoc modo exoratum velim tuam reueren-
tiam, ne quid temere credat Erasmiomastigibus. Nunc fato quodam
suo saeuiunt3 at breui illos sui morbi pudebit, vbi resipuerint, quem-
admodum euenit Aiaci. Bene vale, Pater amplissime, et in Erasmum
eum te praebere perge qui semper fuisti.
Antuuerpiae. Octauo Galen. Iunias. Anno M.D.X1X.

975984 Το ANTONY PAPINms,

Farrago p. 370. Louvain.
F. p. 460: HN: Lond. xi. 18: LB. 430. <262² May> 1519.

[In this letter is the first mention of Erasmus’ edition of Cyprian ; which was
dedicated to Cardinal Pucci, 31 J uly 1519, and printed by Froben, Feb. 1520.

Gembloux was a Benedictine abbey about 23 miles SE. of Brussels, with
a library which was already famous in the Middle Ages: for traces of its
manuscripts see P. Lehmann, F. Modius als Handschriftensorscher‚ 1908, pp. 81—3.
Resides the Cyprian Erasmus subsequently borrowed from it a MS. of Augustine
(Horawitz v. 80 .

Ant. Papinius> († 0. 19 Aug. 1541) of Ath was received as Abbot 10 Feb. 1518.
His house had joined the Bursfeld Congregation in 15053 and one of his first
acts was to send some of his monks‚ at the request of Wm. BoHart, Abbot of
St.. Trond (cf. Ep. 761. 40 n.), to introduce there the reformed way of life. He
built much at Gembloux and enlarged the library from which he was so ready
to lend ι see GC. iii. 566‚7 and U. Berliere, Monastz'con Belye, 1890, pp. 24, 162.

The dates of this letter and its answer conflict. The variant which appears
in N² was perhaps an attempt to rectify this, but made in the wrong place.
Leclerc emends Ep. 984 3 but thus makes the rather large interval of four weeks,
1-29 June, between the two letters. A simple correction is to suppose the dis-
appearance of some figure after Lommz'z', perhaps υἱεῖ]

Ex indice bibliothecae vestrae, cuius mihi iampridem facta est
copia, intelligo apud vos esse duos codices manu descriptos perue-
tustos, opuscula diui Cypriani continentes. Mihi certe gestit animus
hunc autorem orbi tradere repurgatum a mendis, deinde discretum
ab iis quae illi falso inscribuntur; quando non alium video inter eos
qui Latine scripserunt, qui ad apostolici pectoris vigorem propius
accedat. Vbique sentias loqui pastorem ac martyrio destinatum.
Et huiusmodi viros theologi sinimus obsolescere, quo magis miremur-
