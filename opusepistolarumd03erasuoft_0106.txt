647. F ROM ADRIAN BARLAND.

Deventer Ms. 91, f. 224 (a). <Louvain.>
LB. App. 99. (August‘? 1517.)

[By Hand B in the MS„ and therefore probably between April and October
1517. As in Ep. 611, the siglum is sometimes divided. From Barland’s apolo-
gies for the rarity of his visits it may be placed at some time after Erasmus·
settlement at Louvain.

Confirmation for this date may be obtained from the movements of the
Cardinal mentioned, the young William Croy (c. 1498—6 Jan. 1521). He was

⁷ the second son of Henry Croy, Gount of Porcian, younger brother of Chievres
(Ep. 532. 27 n.). This powerful minister, having no children of his own,
advanced his nephew with amazing pertinacity. In Feb. 1516 he tried to
obtain for him the Abbey of St. Martin's at Tournay ; but failed in competition
with Wolsey and the Pope. Later in 1516 the young man received the Abbey
of Afflighem, near Alost (GC. v. 40), and in succession to his kinsman (Ep. 497)
the bishopric of Cambray. In March 1517 it was proposed that he should be
coadjutor to Philip of Burgundy (Ep. 603) in the see of Utrecht3 on 2 April
he was created Cardinal; in August he was mentioned as a likely Abp. of
Seville ; in December Chievres secured for him the archbishopric of Toledo, the
richest see in Spain, in succession to Ximenes3 and in April 1519 it was
expected that he would be {effatus de latere. See Brewer. At some time also he
succeeded Briselot (Ep. 597. 4 n.) at Hautmont (GC. iii. 118).

After severe illness in May 1517 (Brown ii. 894) he was invested with the
cardinalate at Middelburg on 12 July 1517, and then returned to Brabant
(Brewer ii. 3472 : cf. Grachard iii. 34-6). He settled at Louvain to resume his
studies, and was at first a pupil of Barland. By Lent (1518), which he spent
at Cambray (cf. Ep. 794. 17, 8), he had secured Vives as his tutor ; but four months
of the summer were spent in the reformation of Affiighem (Vives' Opuscula varia,
Louvain, Th. Martens, s. (1., ff. h v⁰ and a² v⁰: the latter reference being a letter
from him to Vives). He continued his studies at Louvain under the care of
Vives through 1519 and part of 1520, and exchanged some letters with Erasmus
(see Epp. 917, 945, 951, 957-9); and he was probably still there when John Thierry
delivered an oration in his honour, 16 Jan. 1520 (van Iseghem‚ No. 165). 011
Charles' return from Spain he joined him at Brussels, 27 June 1520 (Brewer iii.
883), and thereafter was with him, at Calais in July (Brown iii. 106), Cologne
in Nov. (Brewer iii. 1044), and lVorms, where he died from a fall from his
horse whilst hunting (see Ciaconius iii. 346).

Cornelius Grapheus' poem on St. William of Aquitaine, Paris, J. Badius,
Easter 1518 (see Renouard, Badius, ii. 476), and Latomus' dialogue De trium
&uquarum et studii theoloyz‘ci ratione, Antwerp, M. Hillen‚ (c. March> 1519, are
addressed to him.]
