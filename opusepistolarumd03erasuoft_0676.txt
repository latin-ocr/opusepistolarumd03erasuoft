622 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 9

Cicero (VE. s³. 29). Perhaps c. Sept. 1517 he contributed some verses (f. 38) to
Eck’ s edition of Dionysius the Areopagite⁷ s De mystica theol-aym, Augsburg, J. Miller,
25 May 1519 (see Wiedemann’s Eck, pp. 495—9); and 111 Oct. others (f0. a3) to
Vadianus' edition of Pomponius Mela, Vienna, J.Sing1·,en May 1518. Vadianus
passed him on to Urban Regius at Ingolstadt in Nov. (VE. 107)· , and he was still
there in March 1518, when he produced a poem against the Turks (Bocking‚
Hutteni Opp. v. 205—16). In May he was at Augsburg, where Miller printed
an oration by him on the same theme, addressed to Maximilian (ibid. 217—228).
Later he matriculated at Leipzig, and having made a name with an oration
De laudibus eloquentiae, 23 Aug. (printed by Lotther c. 25 Aug. ; Proctor ii. 11368),
in which he describes himself (f0. Αἵ) as of ‘immatura aetas ', he was appointed
to lecture through the winter on Quintilian : but for his reputation there see
Ep. 911. 44—6. A letter from him to Pirckheimer, 3 J an. 1519, thanks for
hospitality shown at Nuremberg (Heumann li). In the spring he left Leipzig
and came to visit Erasmus at Louvain ς perhaps by way of Erfurt, if some verses
addressed to him in Eobanus’ Syluae, bk. iii, belong to this period. Missing
Erasmus he went on, perhaps to Paris (cf. l. 88 n.). «

After this his life can only be traced at intervals. He perhaps came again into
Erasmus' circle: for there is a character named Parthenius in the Conuiuium
Poeticum, first printed in Froben's edition of the Colloquies‚ Aug. 1523.

In 1527 he published a dialogue, Sylla, s. l., in defence of Diocletian, addressed to
John Lascaris. In June 1530 he was ambassador of John Zapolya, the claimant
King of Hungary, employed at Constantinople (Τ. Wierzbowski, Materyaly do
Dziejo'w Pis‘miennictwa Polslcieyo, i, 1900, p. 39); and in Oct. 1531 he was still there
(Brewer v. 471). By 1543 he was secretary to Ferdinand, and June-Aug. was
sent by him to England to ask for aid against the Turks (ibid. xviii. i. 659, 894,
925, ii. 26); and in May 1545 he was in Cracow, perhaps on a similar missioni,
when he composed an Admonitio to the nobles of Poland, Gracow, H. Vietor, 1545,
exhorting them to avoid the internal schisms which had caused the downfall of

Hungary.]
ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS TRANQVILLO PARTHENIO DALMATAE S. D.

SCRIPSERAM ex Antuuerpia‚ doctissime Tranquillo, vt, si nondum
abisses, detinerent te Louanii dies aliquot in reditum meum; aut si
id non possent, efficerent certe ne discederes, ni prius mecum col-
locutus: me meo sumptu sarturum eius morae dispendium. Sed

5 abiturientis celeritas epistolam nostram anteuertit. Itaque Louanium
reuersus pro Tranquillo meo geminum carmen reperi, vtrunque iuxta
doctum sed vtrunque sane querulum3 quorum alterum testatur
abisse te iratum huic Academiae, alterum mihi. In illo nos omnis
barbaricae cuiusdam inhumanitatis reos agis: cui volenti nobis edere

¹0 specimen eruditionis tuae, literas nobis impartire, locus datus non sit,
cum caeterae scholae premiis ad id inuitent quod tu gratis et sponte
deferebas. In hoc me vt hominem Batauum et a Gratiis alienum
incusas, qui repulerim a colloquio te quem amor videndi nostri e tam
longinquo per itinera difficillima in regionem ignotam pertraxisset.

¹5 Verum ego tibi vti-iusque nomine respondeb03 sed meam ipsius
causam prius agam.

Primum vero verius est, optime Tranquille, quod id temporis·
Antuuerpiae versabar in negociis quibusdam mihi molestissimis.
