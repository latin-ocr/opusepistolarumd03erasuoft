ERASMVS LISTRIO SVO S. D.

Scmpffl heri per canonicum quendam bis canonicum, sed nigrum.
Rursum scribo per Gosuinum. Si nondum edita est in Mormellium
inuectiua, suadeo rogoque vt eam premas3 minatur enim Buschius
Nolim hoc voluptatis exhiberi sceleratis
istis bonorum studiorum hostibus. Nondum certum qua sim ir-
rupturus in Germaniam3 nam cupio Basileam repetere, si liceat.
Hermanum tuum nondum vidi. Neuius indigne fert quod iuuenem
sibi litteris commendatum Gosuinus Dorpio tradiderit; nam inter
eos parum conuenit. Et profecto parum ciuiliter factum a Dorpio,
nedum dolo. Bene vale.

Ad hyemem proximam volente Christo vos reuiso.

nescio quid ἀντικατηγορίας.

Mormellium] John Murmell (c.
1480 —- 2 Oct. 1517) of Roermond. He
was at school at Deventer under
Hegius, and niatriculated at Cologne
14 Apr. 1496, entering the Bursa
Laurentiana. After obtaining his
licence for M.A. 14 March 1500, he
went to Miinster and, through the influ-
ence of Rud. Langen, was appointed
conrector of the Cathedral school. This
post he held till 1512, with an interval
of uncertain length from Easter 1508
onward, during which he was head
of the school attached to St. Ludger's
church at Miinster. In Lent 1513 he
went as headmaster to Alcmar; but
when the town was sacked by Gueldrian
bandits in June 1517 he lost his posses-
sions, and⁷ the school declining‚ he was
obliged to seek work elsewhere. After
failing to obtain it at Zwolle‚ he died
suddenly at Deventer (cf. Ep. 697. 1 n. ).

His influence was strong 111 favour of
humanism. He wrote and edited nearly
fifty books for use in his schools : and it
was at his suggestion that Caesarius
(Ep. 374) came to Miinster in 1512 to
lecture on Greek.
