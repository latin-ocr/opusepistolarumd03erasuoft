595] FROM BRUNO AMORBAOH 3

vacuum. Malui enim ineptiae quam negligentie a te accusari. Tu,
si ad nos scribere contingat, si non propriis literis dignaris, saltem

alienis salutem scribe. Bonifacius frater (et) Chonradus te non
vulgariter salutant.

596. To (WILLIAM WARHAM Z).

Deventer MS. 91, f. 64 v0. (Louvain.)

(e. 10 July 1517.)

[This fragment was disregarded by Leclerc. It follows Ep. 597 in the manu-
script; but after a few lines, though there is more space below, the copyist
(Hand D) scratched it through, perhaps intending to copy it on a new sheet, now
lost. As to the person addressed only conjecture is possible. Warham is
suggested by the invitation given in Ep. 558, especially ll. 13—5‚ and by the fact
that Ep. 597 is addressed to England. An approximate date may be assigned
from the similarity to Epp. 597 and 607, and from the movements of Charles3
who remained in Ghent (cf. Ep. 584. 29 n.) till 20 June and then left for Bruges.
arriving at Middelburg 5 July (Brewer ii. 3378,9‚ 3426, 3453). Erasmus was still
at Antwerp on 5 June (Ep. 586), but then followed the Court to Ghent and
Bruges (cf. Epp. 597.16 n., 608.5, 621.12, 651.7‚ 7391), perhaps in his official
capacity as Councillor. It was even proposed that he should accompany
Charles to Spain (Apol. ad Iac. Fabrum, LB. ix. Ι7Α; cf. Epp. 694. 4, 5, 809. 127,8‚
853. 2‚3): but he declined, and on the King's departure for Middelburg betook

himself to Louvain, this choice of residence being, as he afterwards represents
(Lond. i. 2 : LB. 587), dictated by Chai-les]

Ammssmn pater, salutem plurimam. Nos Louanium commi·
grauimus, donec dispiciamus que sedes sit aptissima senectuti iam
pulsanti, imo iam vrgenti. Princeps Carolus Middelburgi est, illinc,
vt putant, soluturus in Hispaniam . . .

[The text, as copied by Hand D <John Smith: cf. Ep. 772 introd.) in the
Deventer Letter-book, is inaccurate, and has needed frequent correction in LB.
The limits of date possible are given by Epp. 596 and 601.]

took him to Basle in 1518 to correct the
new edition of the N ew Testament

Furter, the printer (BRE. 166). His
name occurs in Zw. E. up to 1523. 34 ;

(Ep. 886); and he succeeded so well
(cf. Froben's letter, 5 Feb. 1519, p. 566
of Nouum Test. 1519), that he remained
in Basle working for Froben (BRE. 125
and Zw. Ε..) After visits to Berne in
Oct. 1519 (BRE. 128,9) and Feb.—
March 1520 (BRE. 152‚7), he married
in May and set up as a teacher of Greek
at Basle (Zw. Est 133. 137-8, 140, 148) ;
his wife being a daughter of Mieh.

but after that there is no trace of him
until 1534, when Jo. Rfitiner notes in
his Diary (St. Gallen MS„ Vadiana),
no. 502, that Nepos was printing
with (probably, i. e., correcting for) his
‘ brother-in-law’, H. Froben, in a
house near St. Alban's ch. at Basle.
