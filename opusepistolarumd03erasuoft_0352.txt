Louvain.
26 April 1518.

[Between the death of Busleiden and the publication of D1. Erasmus perhaps
hoped that Lascaris, who was now on a visit to France (cf. Ep. 865. 57‚8), might
accept the invitation himself.]

Ep. 860. 26 as referring to Erasmus'
request for the acceptance of the dedi-
cation of Jerome (Epp. 333-5). Taken
alone, this and Ep. 860 would naturally
seem to refer to letters in answer to the
dispateh of the Nouum lustramentum (cf.
Epp. 446. 68-70, 456. 211-3) ; which
might suitably be described as ⁴ ante
biennium fere missas’. But in Aug.
1516 (Epp. 456. 200-11‚ 457. 30-8)
Erasmus writes of replies which had
come from the two Oai-dinals and had
missed him through being forwarded
by Ammonius to Basle (cf. Ep. 860.
27-9) ; and that these were replies to
Epp. 333,4 and not to letters about the
dispatch of the volume is clear, since
they are twice mentioned with Leo's
replics (Epp. 338,9) to Ep. 335, and
since also Erasmus was then unaware
whether the volume had been delivered
to Leo or not (Ep. 456. 212). The

Cardinals perhaps wrote on both occa-
sions; but even if they did, it seems
hardly likely thet their letters should
have gone astray a second time. lt
may therefore be inferi-ed that here
and in Ep. 860 Erasmus was thinking
of Ep. 340 and its accompanying letter
from Grimani. Eighteen months later
Erasmus was still endeavouring to
elicit from his patron some sort of reply
to Ep. 334; see Lond. xiii. 7, LB.462.
It is noticeable that in Epp. 338.
2 5 n., 4 56. 200 seq. Erasmus endeavours
to create the impression that Leo’s
sanction for the Nouum lustramentum
had been asked and obtained, as well
as for Jerome. He perhaps intended
something of the sort here 3 or confu-
sion may have arisen in his mind
through not having seen the letters.
