560 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1519

956. To ANTONY DE LA MARCK.

Paraphrasis ad Galatas f0. a². (Louvain.)
(c. April fin. 1519.)

[The prefacc to the Paraphrase on Galatians. This had been begun in February
(Apol. pro decl. matrim. : LB. ix. 112 Α), but was interrupted by a series of
⁴ tragedies', i. e. the necessity of replying to various opponents : Briard (p. 93),
Lee and others (Epp. 946, 952. 17 11.). Α precise date is not possible. The
passage in Ep. 952. 40 seems to imply that the Paraphrase was not yet completed.
If that inference be accepted, the preface may be dated about the end of April.

The first edition is by Martens, Louvain‚ May 1519 (α), reprinted by Froben
in August (β). It was printed again by Froben with Romans (Ep. 710) and
Corinthians (Ep. 916) 111 Jan. 1520 without change 3 but there are marks of revi-
sion in Froben’s collected editions of March 1521 (γ’) and J uly (δ). Τ110 preface
appears without further change in Froben's editions of Feb. and May 1522; but
after that it was removed—for an obvious reason—‚ and in the later collections
this Paraphrase was printed without any dedication. A copy of α was sent to
England on 25 May 1519 (cf. Ep. 974). On 22 Aug. 1519 Boniface Amerbach
writes to Zasius that β is not yet finished (Basle MS. D. IV. 18. 157).

Antony (c. 1495-1523), son of Robert de la Mal-ck (p. 182), at an early age
began to acquire preferment. In J an. 1515 110 was Canon of Liege. On 18 March
1516 he surrendered to Aleander (Journal, ed. Omont, pp. 17, 31) his claim on
the Provostship of St. John’s at Liege 3 and in the spring of 1517 he was Arch-
deacon of Brabant (Al. E. ii, p. 357). In 1518 he received the Cluniae Abbey of
Beaulieu in Argonne, sw. of Verdun, of which his uncle, the Bp. of Liege (p. 167),

out success (Lond. xv.p11‚ LB. 386). As Agbot, the rapacity of his'officials and
his own lIcentious conduct soon made him odious to his neighbours. For pro-
tection he meditated reverting, like his uncle, to the Burgundian allegiance.
But before he could effect this, his abbey was stormed by the French, and he
himself was stabbed to death by a neighbouring landowner, whose daughter he
had wronged.

CLARISSIMO COMITI ANTONIO DE MARCA ERASMVS
ROTERODAMVS S. D.

CVM iam admolitus manum Paraphrasi in Epistolam Pauli ad
Galatas identidem animo circunspicerem cui laborem eum dedicarem,
quandoquidem hic mos a priscis vsque saeculis in haec nostra tempora
perdurauit‚ commodum allata est per Paschasium Bersellium, tibi
toto pectore deditum, tuae celsitudinis epistola, modis omnibus prae
se ferens animum erectum, excelsum ac plane talibus stemmatis
dignum, ingenium ardens ac sublimi illi philosophiae natum, quae
nos ad coelestium rerum contemplationem auocans‚ rerum harum
humilium quas abiectum vulgus admiratur, contemptum adducit.

Ea quidem res mihi non perinde mira fuit atque grata, praesertim
reputanti patris tui Roberti dotes, viri in bellicae rei laudibus vel*
cum Scipionibus ac Pyrrhis conferendi, tum generosissimae matris
