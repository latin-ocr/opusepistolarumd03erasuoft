989] FROM NICHOLAS BERALDUS 619

Decanum, euocarem. Is enim in hac, vt sic dixerim, palaestra
prouocati abs te mauult quam te prouocare: vir alioqui in quouis
scribendi genere non mediocriter antehac versatus, bonarumque
omnium sed diuinarum praesertim literarum adeo studiosus, vt
quem huic praeferamus habeamus profecto neminem. Eius nomine
interim tibi salutem adscribo. Rogo insuper ne hominis integerrimi
simul et humanissimi familiaritatem asperneris, qui cum multis
nominibus tum hoc praecipue dignus est amicitia tua, quod eam
tantopere tamque, prope dixerim, ambitiose expetit3 quantouis
precio empturus, nisi Erasmus cunctis obuius gratisque expositus
esset. Salutat te Deloinus, Ruzaeus, omnes. Budaeus, cum haec
scriberem, ruri cum vxore ac liberis agebat; propediem in vrbem

rediturus, simulatque, vt puto, vxor parturiens pepererit Budaeique
familiam auxerit. Vale.

990. To JOHN CLAYMOND.

[Between the foundation of Corpus and the publication of the Farrago (E) 1519
is the only year in which Erasmus was at Louvain at this time.

John Claymond or Olaimond (c. 1457 -— 19 Nov. 1537) of Frampton in Lincoln-
shira, spent most of his life in Oxford. He was a Demy of Magdalen in 1483,
Fellow 1488, and President 1504 : B.D. 1508, D.D. 1510. About 1487 he became
known to Foxe, who gave him the Mastership of St. Gross Hospital near Win-
chester 1505-24, and in 1517 persuaded him to leave Magdalen and preside over
the new foundation, Corpus Christi. This office he held until his death ; and
during his life he also held benefices in the counties of Somerset, Hants, Durham‚
and Worcester. He was a man of exceptional public spirit and of great sincerity
of character. Erasmus, who had perhaps met him in Oxford in 1499, speaks of
him always as a theologiam but his only known work is some collections for
notes on Pliny N. H., which exist in ms. in the College library and also 111
duplicate in the Library at Basle: the former mostly autograph, the latter
partially so. He is also credited with notes on Plautus and Gellius. Vives
found him a friend and patron (Vi. E. ff. 14 νο, 25, 44). In Feb. 1526 Erasmus
dedicated to him translations of Chrysostom’s De sato and De prouidentia Dei. In
the summer of 1531 Sim0n Grynaeus received assistance from him on a visit to
Oxford in search of MSS. to be printed at Basle: see the preface to Plato and
hoelus, Basle, J. Valder, March 1534, and Claymond's letter of 13 May (1532)
in Grynaeus’ Epistozaa Basle, J. Oporinus, Oct. 1556, f. 161. Among the Corpus
MSS. (318. 23, ed. H. Ο. Coxe) is an autograph letter written by Linacre from
London to Claymond when President of Magdalen, sending him a pupil and
urging him to learn Greek.
