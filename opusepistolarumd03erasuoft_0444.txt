[The course of Erasmus' journey from Basle to Louvain is easy to follow in
this letter, but the precise dates of each stage are more difficult. He was still
at Basle on 1 Sept„ when he received Ep. 810 (cf. Epp. 869. 1—2‚ 886. 40,1) ; but
after that the only fixed point that he gives is that he reached Cologne on a
Sunday. On 15 Sept. it was known at Zurich that he had left Basle (cf. Ep.
861. 5 n.). The first part of his journey occupied at least eight days, according
to the stages mentioned, so that his arrival at Cologne cannot be dated 5 Sept.‚'
but must fall on 12 Sept. The following itinerary may be traced ε

4, 5 Sept. (⁶3) From Basle to Strasburg by boat 3 dining at Breisach on the first
day and sleeping the night at a ⁴ vicus frigidus ’.

5, 6 Sept. (2³) Strasburg reached by boat about 9 am. t the night perhaps spent
there, or possibly a beginning made of the j ourney to Spires.

6, 7 Sept. On horseback to Spires: the distance, 68 miles, required two days
(cf. l. 152), but no place is mentioned for the night.

7-9 Sept. At Spires.

9 Sept. By carriage to Worms and Mainz.

10 Sept. By boat to Boppard and Coblenz.

11 Sept. By boat to Bonn and on towards Cologne.

12 Sept. Cologne reached by boat at 6 3,.111. z in the afternoon on horseback to
Bedburg.

12-17 Sept. At Bedburg.

17 Sept. By carriage to Aachen.

17-19 Sept. At Aachen.

19 Sept. On horseback to Maastricht and Tongres.

20 Sept. To St. Trond ε riding and by carriage.

21 Sept. By carriage to Tirlemont and Louvain (cf. 1. 190 n.).

The first dates are questionable because of the uncertainty of Erasmus' move-
ments at Strasburg. The halts at Spires and Bedburg I have interpreted as in
common parlance ; but if the sense is that he spent two full days at Spires and
three nights, and similarly at Bedburg, then the start from Basle must be dated
2 or 3 Sept. The date of arrival in Louvain accords well with Erasmus’estimate
in 1. 248 that he had been about four weeks in Martens’ house. But his state-
ments in Epp. 888-9‚ 891, 893 that by 23,4 Oct. he had been six weeks in Louvain,
cannot possibly be reconciled with his presence at Basle on 1 Sept. ; and must
