integritate vite raraque doctrina Romanaque facundia insignis, vel
οο mihi nomine precipue colendus, quia cognominis de te perquam
egregiam frequenter facit mentionem, primam (vt aulicus aulico vtar
verbo) audientiam coram Cesare, sacri imperii Electoribus omnibus et
ceteris Germaniarum principibus proceribusque obtinuit. Sic ornate,
sic grauiter orauit, vt ad intima vsque precordia auditorum vehementia
sententiarum penetrauerit pluresque ad fletum concitauerit. Ei vero
docto simul et facundo omnes docti et eloquentes palmam tribuunt.
Aderant enim viri non pauci, tum exquisite docti tum in iudicando
naris emunctissime, Antistes Tergestinus, Peutingerus, Huttenus,
Bartholinus‚ Spalatinus, et Stabius ille in nullo doctrine genere non
versatus, Henricus Sti-omer medicus, et Laurentius Zochus iuriscon-
sultus, Cardinalis Maguntini florentissimi principis cancellarius.
Igitur facta mihi primum pre ceteris elegantissime huius orationis
copia, quia digna multorum lectione visa fuit eruditorum calculo
et ab omnibus desiderata, imprimendam curaui, sub augusto tuo
nomine, quod omnia pietate sacra iure sibi vendicat: quam haud sub-
ducto supercilio accipere digneris. Non dubito quin, vt audientibus
lachrimas commouit, ita hec eadem legentibus magis copiosas excutiet
et in rem Christianam propensiores eorum animos reddet,

Valere tecum bene Rhenanum vere beatum cupio, quem animo
mecum circumfero. Vtrique fila vite quam maxime longeua exopto,
vt in dies magis ac magis felicibus auspiciis bone littere et maxime
sacre refloreant. Huttenus, quia nihil est visus cecutientibus popu·
laris litterationis admiratoribus, Neminis nihil peperit: quem te

made obedience to Leo x for Maxi-

milian (Pastor vii. 70, 451). See Trith.³;

from his master, Alexander, Duke of
Lithuania. When Alexander became

King of Poland in 1501, Ciolek was
advanced to be Bp. of Plock, 29 Nov.
1503, and in March 1505 was sent
to Rome to offer Alexander's obedience
to Julius 11 ι his oration 011 the occasion
being printed at the time. On the
death of Alexander, 19 Aug. 1506,Ciolek
enjoyed equal influence with Sigis-
mund. His reputation as a diplomatist
was so enhanced by his performance at
Augsburg thatin Nov. 1518 Maximilian
sent him 011 Imperial business to Rome,
where the remainder of his life was
spent as Sigismund's representative.

pp. 263, 265-6)‚ and on return to Ger-
many became Chancellor to the Abp.
of Mainz for the diocese of Magdeburg.

the Reformation, but was converted by
Luther’s books, and in consequence

his release he entered the service of
the Elector of Saxony, and besides ·
serving on embassies was Professor
