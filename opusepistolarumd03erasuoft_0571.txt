933] FROM MARTIN LUTHER 517

John Auristzber, Jena, C. Rhodius, 1556. For convenience Ι have placed it in
the same position here as α 111 Ep. 910.

Martin Luther (10 Nov. 1483 ?—18 Feb. 1546), after schooling at Mansfdd,
Magdeburg and Eisenach, had been at Erfurt University (Β.Α. 1502, M.A. 1505),
and then had withdrawn, 17 July 1505, into the Augustinian house at Erfurt.
After receiving priest's orders in 1507 he emerged in 1508 to teach in the new
university founded by Duke Frederick of Saxony at Wittenberg. In 1510-1 he
made the visit to Rome which so profoundly impressed him ; and having taken
his D.D. 19 Oct. 1512, he succeeded Staupitz (p. 408) as Professor of Theology at
Wittenberg. For a few years he continued to live the quiet life of a teacher,
and was little known. He had published nothing, and of the thousands of his
extant letters only 10 are anterior to 1516. But the 95 theses directed
against indulgences which he posted at Wittenberg 31 Oct. 1517 (cf. Ep. 785.
37 n.) brought him at once into conflict with Rome ; and his writings soon began
to circulate in print (Ep. 904. 19 n.).

His first communication with Erasmus was in 1516, when he wrote to ask,
through Spalatinus. for Erasmus‘ views on a question of theology (Ep. 501 3 cf.
LE2. 25) ; but he quickly came to perceive (LE2. 343 1 March 1517) the funda-
mental difference that was to divide them. His words there about Erasmus,
‘humana praeualent in eo plus quam diuina,’ express the position concisely,
though in a sense that he hardly intended ε the difference between the humanist
scholar secking to advance knowledge in 101101100 011 human reason, and the
religious leader contemning the things of this world and ensuing human advance—
ment and even truth with aid from realms in which reason is not always allowed
to have its perfect work.

Luther did his best to minimize this divergence (LE2. 59, 125; cf. 163. 55).
When he made the present advance to Erasmus, it was still only latent; and he
hoped that mutual respect might be possible, perhaps even mutual help. A day
earlier, in dedicating to Duke Frederick his commentaries 011 the Psalms, he
had written: ‘Ego pro mea temeritate aleam ieci, extrema semper tentare et
exspectare paratus ’ (ULE2. 166. 81, 2). Though he had stood fast against Cajetan
at Augsburg in Oct. 1518, he was still tremulous, his courage not yet stablished
by the triumph at Worms. His friends (cf. Ep. 938), even more than himself,
were conscious of the dangers before him, and sought to rally round him the
support of men of learning.

Erasmus on his side knew Luther only by repute, though the repute was
good (cf. LE2. 92). He had not read Luther’s books ; but he had heard enough
of them to dissuade Froben from printing them (Ep. 904. 19 n.), and he shrank
instinctively from open strise as tending to obscure the issues. His reply‚
therefore, was not cordial‚ and expressed at once his dislike of the troubles
that Luther’s outspokenness was provoking. Yet it was not without encourage-
ment; indeed, as he told Luther, he had already stood forward to defend him
(Ep. 939. 66 seq.), and this defence he repeated to other persons of influence (cf.
Ep. 967. 78 seq.), though without committing himself to Luther’s views.

As the years went on, 110 more and more looked on Luther as retarding the
progress of a movement for peaceful reform, which, impelled in no small measure
by his own writings and influence, had seemed well upon its way. In the joy
of battle and of victory Luther saw Erasmus as one who had not been for him ς
and a personal quarrel followed, embittering their relations for ever. Luther
in his turn lived to regard the advanced Reformers as Erasmus had regarded
him 3 as men who were forcing out of his hands and ruining a movement which
he considered his own.]
