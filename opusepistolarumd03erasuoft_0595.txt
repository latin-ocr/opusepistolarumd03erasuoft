548] ΤΟ PETER MOSELLANUS 541

with the practice of the time, if Lotther had printed the two orations separately,

but bound them together, adding a colophon to the second one only3 and if

Grimm and Wirsung had then reprinted the two parts together, in their order.
It appears also from Proctor that Lotther was actually printing books at Leipzig
in the summer of 1519 with the same types as lie used for the De ratione disputandi.
Another indication is pointed out by Enders (LE2. 191): that on 4 Aug. 1519
Scheurl at Nuremberg (SE. 209) had seen the oration and the two letters,
presumably in print. It seems hardly possible that Lang’s oration could have
been conveyed to Augsburg, and have been printed, and that then a copy should
have reached Nuremberg, within eight days of the delivery of the oration.

For these reasons I place Lotther's edition (a) before that of Grimm and Wir-
sung (β) ; and as their text differs very materially from that of Erasmus in the
successive volumes of his Epietozm, Ι have given it precedencc. Mosellanus was
then on terms of friendly admiration for Erasmus; and obviously was printing
the letter he actually received. β varies from α only in two insignificant read-
ings (ll. 175, ²53) 3 and may therefore well be a reprint of it. The considerable
additions introduced in F are noticeable. The omission of the mouth-date in E
was probably a mere oversight: or perhaps it had not been noted on the rough
copy from which E was printed. The date given in a eoincides so exactly with
that of Ep. 947 that it may be accepted without question.]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS PETRO MOSELLANO S. D.

IAMPRIDEM ex primis illis tuis ad me literis, mi Petre, ingenium
tuum adamare coepi, quod mihi tum sanum ac festiuum esse videbatur
—nam ingeniis huiusmodi semper vnice sum delectatus: offendit enim
in nonnullis nostratium immane quiddam, plus habens spiritus quam
iudicii—verum hunc amorem auxit posterior epistola, priorem tum
eruditione tum elegantia superans. Caeterum simulatque legissem
orationem illam tuam, qua linguis patrocinaris aduersus eos qui, ad
bene dicendum elingues, ad obtrectandum melioribus studiis lingua-
cissimi sunt, tantam spem de tuo ingenio concepi vt vix de quoquam
alio parem: adeo viuit oratio, adeo fluit secumque rapit lectorem,
solidis* argumentis referta; in quibus inueniendis es acutus, in
tractandis item egregium praestas artificem. Sermo multam
variamque resipit lectionem3 quod in iuuene magis etiam mi-
randum.

Quod scribis istic feruere pugnam inter melioris literaturae pro-
fessores et veteris inscitiae patronos, nihil miror, cum vbique sic
ferueat vt prorsus res vel ex conspiratione vel fato quodam geri
videatur. Astrologos aliquot consului, huius artis professione claros ;
