578 LETTERS OF ERASMUs [1519

Antuerpiae xvnI. Calend. Maias scriptis, cum ob alia non pauca,
tum quod eruditissimae simul et elegantissimae tuum erga nos,
synceram et veram Christi eruditionem et Euangelicam veritatem,
studium et amorem pientissimum iam pridem nobis exploratum
fecerunt perspectiorem.

Est, vt scribis, mira osorum melioris doctrinae conspiratio, in id
solum idonea, vt bonis, piis et probe literatis noceat. Non damnari
ab eruditis causam Lutheranam, et Doctoris Martini lucubrationes ab
optimis quibusque istic cupidissime legi, laetamur3 eoque magis
quod plerique bonorum et eruditorum in nostris quoque regionibus
et principatibus, nedum externis, hominis tam vitam et mores quam
eruditionem miro consensu laudant. Quod enim hactenus in
Saxonibus nostris degit, non tam homini quam causae dedimus,
nihil minus vnquam conati quam vt dignos premiis poena premeret.
Neque Deo omnipotente iuuante committemus vt nostra culpa inno-
cens quispiam sua querentium impietati dedatur.

Ad haee, Deo autore, bonis literis et rectis studiis, et eorum tam
professoribus quam studiosis, non minus in posterum fauebimus
quam hactenus fauimus: id quod pro praecipua nostra erga te
gratia latere te noluimus in praesentiarum. Bene vale, doctissime
Erasme.

[The import of the series of letters addressed to England at this time
(Epp. 961-2, 964-7) is quite clear. Without making a direct request, Erasmus
intimated that he would be glad to return and settle there, if suitable provision
could be made for him—-pi'ovision, of course, which should ensure him leisure
and not infringe his independence.

When he last left England he had felt himself secure, without need to look to
English help (Ep. 577). He had taken service with charles (Ep. 370. 18 n.), and
his allegiance required that he should settle in the Netherlands : the revision of
the New Testament was oecupying his thoughts, and the way seemed open for
him to complete and print it. But in two years his world had changed. The
New Testament was indeed finished; but it had brought many enemies, and
Louvain had become a less pleasant home than he had expected. Charles had
gone off to Spain (Epp. 948. 195, 969. 16, 970. 13), the promised pension only once
paid (Ep. 597. 26 n.). Le Sauvage, whom he regarded as his special patron
(Ep. 887. 8,9 ; cf. Ep. 436), was dead ; and the offer from Ferdinand (p. 492) did
not attract him. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that he should
have bethought himself to accept (cf. Epp. 825. 14-5, 855. 28-9) one of the
numerous invitations he had received in recent years (Ep. 809. 127-33). ’

From England in particular these had been promising (Ep. 694. 10), though
somewhat elusive when he showed signs of wishing to accept them (Epp. 775.
18-21, 784. 54-7. 786. 34—4o‚ 806. 13—4). Henry had assui-ed him he should have
