62 LETTERS OF E RASMUS [1 5 1 7

20 Orator Venetus et pariter cum suo Sagundino, qui nuper sudarunt,
te maxime salumn cupiunt. Hoc idem Ammonius noster faciebat 3
sed, proh dolor, spacio octo horarum sudario morbo absumptus est,
tanto animi mei moerore, tanta tristicia, vt nullo remedio solari
queam. Sed quid vis fieri? sic est mortalium cursus. Vale, mi

25 doctissime et candidissime Erasme, nomenque nostri apud te serua.

Ex Antwerpia v Cal. Septemb. 1517.

640. To <JOHN PETER CARAFFA>.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 55 v0. Louvain.
LB. App. 171. 29 August (1517).

[It seems clear that this letter is addressed to Caraffa, who was now presum-
ably in Middelburg (Ep. 628. 54 n.); and to whom, as a Neapolitan, the final
wish would be appropriate. The fears expressed in 11. 3, 4 may be an attempt to
convey the warning desired in Ep. 628. 55-7.

The year-date may be assigned from the mention of Erasmus' settlement at
Louvain and his agreement with the theologiam]

S. P„ reuerendissime Pater. Scripsi pridem celsitudini tuae.
Si non mereor (epistolam), saltem fac sciam qua sis valetudine3
cui nonnihil timeo ob coeli istius inclementiam, ab incolarum ingenio
non abhorrentis. Nos Louanii in mediis theologis viuimus‚ grati

nos aliquando iungat in museis Neapolitanis! Bene vale, decus

litterarum et religionis. Louanii 4. Cal. Sept.

641. To GEORGE HALEWIN.

Auctarium p. 185. Louvain.
F. p. 159: HN: Lond. iii. 27: LB. 264. 29 August (1517).

[1517 because of the migration to Louvain.

George (a. 1473 - Sept. 1536), Lord os Halewin through his father, and of
Comines through his mother, who was a niece of the historian, and governess
to Mary of Burgundy and Philip the Fair. His position required of him some
duties at Court; and he accompanied Charles to Spain at this time (Ep. 794. 84,5).
After his wife’s death ho was persuaded to take orders in 15193 but the proposal
to make him Bp. of Tournay was not carried out. In 1520 he attended Charles
to the Field of the Cloth of Gold (Brewer iii. 907) ; and he was still at Court in
1522 (ΕΕ. 6), and perhaps in 1524 (Brewer iv. 457). But his interests were
literary, and he preferred to spend his life in retirement on his estates, which
lay between Ypres and Courtray. By Oct. 1508 he had composed a Restauratio
