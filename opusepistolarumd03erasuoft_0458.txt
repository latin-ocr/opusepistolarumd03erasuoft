406 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 51 8

being withheld from publication at Lang's wish (JE. 21). It is not clear why
Ep. 875, which was afterwards printed by Erasmus in E, does not appear
in Eobanus' book: possibly Werter had passed out of his reach, bearing the
letter with him. It may also be noticed that Erasmus never reprinted any
of the letters which are in the Hodoeporicon.

Ecbanus sent a copy of a to Beatus Rhenanus at Basle‚ drawing his attention
to the blunders of the printers: now at Schlettstadt‚ Cat. Rhen. 235. Another
copy, evidently with a similar inscription, was sent to Erasmus at Louvain (Ep.
982); where it was shortly afterwards reprinted by Martens (β), also S. a.‚ with
some additions. One of these is Ursinus’ poem in praise of Erasmus (Ep. 851.
48 n.) ς the second is a poem by Goelen entitled Lucubrationum Erasmicarum
Elenchus, which is perhaps a versification of Luc. Ind. (cf. l. 9 11.). To it is
prefixed a letter of eulogy from Gilles, with the dates 21 May 1519, Antwerp;
and the latest of Erasmus’ compositione mentioned is the Paraphrase on Galatians
4Ep. 956), of which Martens printed the first edition in May 1519.

Epp. 870-1, 874, 876 are printed by Draco in EHE. pp. 256-8 (γ). Ι11 Ep. 871 ’γ
has two independent readings, and in Epp. 874,6 twice follows β instead of
α. Three of these may be intentional corrections, two (which are incorrect)
perhaps arising from unfamiliarity with the form M.D.xnx 3 while the remaining
two are mere differences in the spelling of names. This slight divergence
therefore need not prevent the inference (which is antecedently probable) that
Draco had α as his basis.

The omission of Ep. 873 in O1 probably shows that Merula was printing from ·γ;
and this conclusion is supported by his variants, those in Epp. 870—1, 874 being
