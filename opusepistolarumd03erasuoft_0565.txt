Nicolaum Beraldum habet. Sed ego ineptus qui iam plane incipiam
arenas numerare. Inter tot egregia lumina quid ego aliud quam
obscurari poteram ⁶? et tamen iuuerit etiam sic obscurari, modo frui

liceret iis qui mihi caliginem offundere videntur.

nec asseuero nec inficior; sic natus vt Gallusne an Germanus sim,
anceps haberi possit. Quanquam apud studiorum cultores minimum
habere momenti par est regionum discrimina: quisquis communibus
Musarum sacris initiatus est, hunc ego ὂμοπάτριδα duco.

Ex amicorum literis audio Budaeum nonnihil succensere nobis ob 45

epistolam quandam meam, vt ipsi videtur, aliquanto quam par est
liberiorem. Ego vero illum et virum iudico prudentiorem quam qui
grauius commoneatur, si quid etiam intempestiuius aut licentius
scribat amiculus 3 et firmiorem amicum arbitror quam vt ob huius·

modi leues offensas amicus esse desinat. Nam mea sententia quisquis 50

ob quaslibet causas amicus esse desiit, is nunquam amicus fuit.
Equidem non satis video quid habeat illa mea epistola tam procax
aut petulans vt animum concitare debuerit, primum eruditi, deinde

his studies (Champerius' De triplici
doctrina, Lyons, S. Vincent, 28 Feb.
1503, ff. ΑΒ, C⁷ v0.). In 1508 he was
appointed Clerk to the Parliament of
Toulouse, where he spent some years,
rising to be Councillor in 1515. To
this period, perhaps, belongs his De
vita aulica, Toulouse, s, α. 011 30 July
1515 he accompanied Francis 1 to Italy,
and was made a member of the Senate
of Milan. In Oct. he was sent on
an embassy to the Pope 3 but in J an.
1516 was appointed resident ambassa-
dor at Venice. Whilst there he dedi-
cated to Ant. and Wm. Duprat, sons of
the Chancellor osFrance,Allobr09ica N ar-
ratio, A. de Bindonis,2o Nov. 15 16,a Latin
paraphrase of the romance of Paris and
Vienne. He also composed a life of
St. Roche, addressed to the Chaneellor,
and began a translation of Dio Cassius :
but Ι cannot find that either was ever
printed. Two Aldine volumes are
dedicated to him, the Orationes of Gre-
gory Nazianzen by Musurus, April
1516, and the Horace by Fr. Asulanus,
Nov. 1519. From May 1520 to Feb.
1521 he was resident at the Papal
Court; and his diplomatic letters of
this period are preserved in the Bibl.
Nationale at Paris. On 6 Feb. 1523 he
was elected Bp. of Pamiers; but the
see being contested, in compensation
he was given in 1523 that of Rieux,
which he held till his death. He re-
sided‚ however, at Toulouse (cf. EE2.

142), whence he corresponded with
Sadolet in 1530, and 1532-5 with
Erasmus; one of whose letters in-
volved him in a charge of heresy. In
Aug. 1532 he made the acquaintance
of Dolet, to whom in 1534 he extended
his protection3 see their letters in
Dolet’s Orationes ad Tholosam (Lycus,
S. Gryphius, Aug-Sept. 1534), pp. 85-
9, 142-5, 148—51. The third book of
John Vulteius' Epiqramnzata, Lycus,-
J. Barbous, 1537, is dedicated to him,
with a preface, 12 March 1537, which
refers to the translation from Dio as
still unfinished. L. Regius shows (G.
Budaez' Vita, 1540, pp. 5506, 60-1) that
he was one of the Bp.'s household,
1535-7-

Eighteen Greek MSS. collected by
De Pins passed at his death into
Francis 1's library at Fontainebleau ;
see Delisle, Cabith des MSS. i. (1868),
152.

For De Pins' life see his Letter-book
(Nimes MS. 215, kindiy brought to my
notice by Prof. J. L. Gerig of Columbia
University), from which it appears
that Lond. xxv. 3, LB. 1203 must be
addressed to Geo. ffArmagnac, ‘Epo.
