168 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 517

continually at the expense of both France and Burgundy. Erard, after study-
ing at Cologne, received in 1500 a canonry in Liege cathedral, and on 30 Dec.
1505 was elected Bp. ; taking priest's orders 13 May 1506. He at first followed
his elder brother Robert (p. 182) in adherence to France, and in 1507 obtained
from Louis xu the see of Chartres. As the price of wavering in this allegiance
Maximillam in 1509 granted him the princely rights pertaining to the see of
Liege3 and the detachtnent went gradually on, aided by French indifference,
until on 27 April 1518 the two brothers signed a secret treaty with Maximilian’s
representativcs at St. Trond, and made provision for their defection from
Francis 1. In compensation for the ensuing loss of Chartres, Erard received the
:ibprie of Valencia in Spain and a cardinal's hat, both in 1520; and though
Robert reverted to France in 1521, Erard remained faithful henceforward to
Burgundy.

His wealth and position inclined him at first to hostility to Rome. He
declared himself to this effect at the Diet of Augsburg in 15183 and in 1519
Erasmus, who was seeing much of him (Epp. 916. 4, 927, 978 and Lond. xi. 24,
LB. 450), regarded him as favourable to Luther (1113ss 191. 44). But his
promotion in 1520 won him over, and he became a determined opponent of
heresy3 though at the same time a vigorous corrector of abuses within the
Church: so much so that· in 1525 he was still thought to be inclined towards
Reform (Heumann, p. 3063.

The present interchange of civilities led to intimacy with Erasmus (cf. Ep.
867. 83, 185) ; who dedicated to him his Paraphrase on Corinthians (Ep. 916) and
sent him the two volumes of the second edition of the New Testament on vellum
(1. pp. 43. 38—44. 2; cf. Ep. 848. 8,9†·. They remained in communication so
long as Erasmus lived. His last surviving letter to the Bp. is an appeal for funds
for the Collegium trilingue at Louvain (Lond. xxvi. 22, LB. 1138) 3 and the Bp.'s
regard for him is shown in a letter of 1532 4Bres12u MS. Rehd. 254. 44 ; printed
by Wachter in Zs. cl. bery. Gesclziehtsvereins, xxx, 1894, pp. 2o5‚6).

Brusthem, printed by Reusens in Ball. inst. arch. lidgeois, viii (1866), pp. 1-104. A

Vives (p. 508) dedicated to him an edition of the Somnium Scipionis, Antwerp,

a encia.

SALVTEM plurimam, reuerendissime Praesul. Quod ausus sim
celsitudinem tuam litteris compellare, meo in te studio debes con-
donare; quod parum accurate, morum tuorum facilitati imputabis,
mihi cum ab aliis compluribus tum praecipue ab vnico illo virtutum

5 omnium antistite Stephano Poncherio praedicatae. Quod tam paucis,
id studiorum meorum laboribus ignosces, quibus in praesentia sic
distringor vt non alias aeque. Imo quo minus offendat epistolae
breuitas, mitto et Paulum Romane loquentem, et quidem aliquanto
copiosius solito: nam huiusmodi solatiolis veluti digressionibus me

10 recreo, quoties studiorum in quibus versor satietas tentarit obrepere.
Pro Aleandro euecto quicquid est vsquam hominum bonis fauentium
litteris debet amplitudini tuae. Bene vale. et Erasmum vel inter
extremos clientulos tuos asscribito.
