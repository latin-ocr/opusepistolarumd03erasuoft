Munich MS. Lat. 965, p. 349. <Bres1au.>
(c. 20 June 1518.)

[The manuscrIpt is a composite volume of colleotions made by Dr. Stanislaus
Sauer, canon of Breslau (†1535 ; cf. EE2. 13, VE. s.¹ 11), to illustrate the history of
Silesia, Hungary, and Poland. These were copied for the most part c. 1524 by
his servant-pupil, John Schonwyss. In 1560 the volume was acquired from
Schonwyss by a certain John Dernschwam, perhaps the person of that name
from Hradiczin, who had been Balbus’ pupil 1514—7 ; see Balbus' opera, ed.
de Retzer, 1791, i, p. xxii n. The new owner evidently had some interest in
the Turzo family, for he picks out mentions of them in the various chronicles
and adds marginalia. Schonwyss’ hand ends after a long Section on p. 340 3 and
pp. 341—74 are covered by miscellanea written by two hands, A and B, who may
have been employed by Schonwyss, and in any case are anterior to Dernschwam,
since marginalia by him occur on p. 347. Schonwyss' hand perhaps reappears
on p. 376.

This letter is copied by Hand B. It clearly is contemporary with Ep. 851.

John 'rurzo or Thurzo <16 Apr. 1466 -— 2 Aug. 1520) belonged to an influential
Hungarian family3 but as born and educated at Cracow (BA. 13 Dec. 1484,
M.A. 1487 init.) he styled himself Polonus. After lecturing on Aristotle and
Ovid at Cracow he went to Italy and became Dr. of Canon Law. On return he
was twice Rector of the university and accumulated much preferment ; until in
1502 he was appointed coadjutor-bp. of Breslau. In spite of prolonged opposi-
tion he succeeded to the see in 1506 ; and if his conduct as bp. was more
splendid than effective, he at least showed himself a generous patron to men of
learning, and even projected an edition of Augustine's Epistolae (VE. 83). The
encouragement which he gave to humanism led Luther to hope that he would
favour reform (LE2’. 329, 364 z ME. 84).

The correspondence initiated here gave Turzo great pleasure, and in spite
of difficult communication was carried on until his death. His next letter was
accompanied by a shower of presents ; see Lond. xv. 1, 2, LB. 479, 524.

DESIDERIO ERASMO RODORODAMO ORATORI ET THEOLOGO
SVMMO S. D.

SVMMA et incredibilis virtus tua, eruditio singularis, ingenii celsitudo
et eloquentiae maiestas, perfectissime Erasme‚ que partim lectione
tuorum operum partim tam egregia quam vera doctorum hominum
commendatione mihi innotuerunt, in causa sunt vt ad te 111 presentia
scribere non dubitarim. Nam cum omnium qui ingenii laboribus illu· 5
stres reliquis mortalibus prestant, nunquam non fuerim studiosus, tum
eorum quicum Romana eloquentia Christiane fidei puritatem copula-
uere, obseruantissimus videri cupiam. Qualem te vnum ex vniuersa
mortalitate hec etas diuinitus nacta, maioribus nostris et multis retro
seculis adeo nihil concedit, vt quem obiiciat venerande alioquin 10
antiquitati summis omnibus equalem, reliquis superiorem, habeat
ac iure pre-tendat. Post futuris autem pene spem omnem adimit,
adeo vt sibi simile quiddam vix vnquam audeant polliceri.

Atque ita me dii bene ament vt audito Erasmi nomine mirifice
gestire soleo et exultare. Fit autem hoc non infrequentem habes 15
enim complures vel in his locis eximii ingenii tui miratores nominis-
