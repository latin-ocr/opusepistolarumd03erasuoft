mentioned as a rising young scholar. In a letter (Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 29) from
Ber-ne, 15 Aug. (1518), he expresses regret at the death of Lachner (Ep. 781. 7 n.),
as of one who had helped with the expenses of his education. He accompanied
Nesen to Paris, and in 1519 to Louvain (BRE. 1323 cf. Zw. E2. p. 389) 3 where
the present exchange of compliments helped him to renew with Erasmus the
friendship which had begun in Basle: and he gained high credit from him
(Lond. xv. 13, LB. 502). 011 28 Sept. 1520 he was a pupil of Caesarius at Cologne
(Spalatinus’ Annales, ed. J .B. Menckenius in Script. rer. Germ. ii, 1728, pp. 6023) ;
but in Dec. was at Mainz as secretary to Capito (Basle MSS. KA. 0. IV. 5, i. ff. 121
v⁰., 66 ς Hess ii, p. 553). When Erasmus returned to Basle, Carinus joined him
as his ‘conuiua’ (Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 13. 125: 6 July 1522); and he appears as
a character in the colloquy, Conuiuium poeticum, first printed in Froben's edition
of Aug. 1523. On Nesen's departure from Frankfort Carinus succeeded him as
temporary head of the Latin school, c. July 1523—Oct. 1524 (Steitz, Arch.
f. Frank-funs Gesch.‚ mr. vi, 1877, p. 126) ; and during this period Melanchthon
dedicated to him an edition of Demosthenes’ Ol. 1, Hagenau, J. Secerius‚ 1524
(ME. 309). In 1527 he was teaching at Coblenz rng. 635. 20 n.), but in the
summer matriculated as one of the first students at Marburg, where he came
under the infiuence of the Reformers. On personal grounds he had been angry
with Erasmus for his criticisms of Erasmius Froben's education (Basle MS.
Goelenii Epist., f. 28 ; cf. BRE. 267 and Q. p. 58) and for his censure of Nesen's
share in the Seneca of 1515 (Ep. 325) ; and under the new influence a complete
rupture followed, though in a letter to Nic. Borbonius, 25 Feb. 1533, Paris
(Borbonius' Nugae, Paris, M.Vascosanus, 1533, f0. ΡΒ) 110 still writes of Erasmus
with praise. He continued to maintain himself by private teaching : at Paris in
1533 (Basle MSS. G. II. 26. 197, 16. 1233 Strasburg MSS. Ep. eccl. xvi0. V111. 230,
11. 34; cf. Lond. xxx. 62, LB. 1258) ; in 1536 at Louvain (VZE. 90; cf. Zimmerische
Chromin, ed. K. A. Barack, iii, 1881, p. 164) ; in 1540 at Padua ; in 1544 at Bologna
(ANGB. p. 329). An invitation to preside over the town school at Lucerne he
refused ; but in 1546 at the request of a former pupil‚ Erasmus Schenk, then Bp.
of Stras‘burg‚ he accepted the rectorship of St. Thomas' school there. By his will,
dated 20 Dec. 1563, he founded eight scholarships at Basle University.

As his pupillage lasted until 1520, 110 can hardly be identified, as is sometimes
done, with a Louis Kiel of Lucerne, who in 1496 held an office in the collegiate
church of Beromiinsten and 1513-31 a cauonry.
