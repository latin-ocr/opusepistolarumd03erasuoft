[The date is given quite precisely by Ep. 761.

Antony of Bergen (†J une fin. 1541 : Brewer xvi. 962) was the youngest son of
John, Lord of Bergen (p. 166) and a nephew of the Abbot of St. Bertin's. Since
Nov. 1517 (Ep. 717) 110 had been studying at Louvain, where in 1518 Vives
dedicated to him a Fabula de homine and a Praelectz'o 011 the Georgics (opuscula varia,
Louvain, Th. Martens, s.a.‚ f0. z νο). Inspired perhaps by Erasmus (cf. Ep.
969) his father procured him a place in Henry vm's court (Brewer iii.
12); and in Nov. 1519 Antony went to England, equipped with introductions
from Margaret of Austria (ibid. 4963 cf. 517) and from Erasmus (Lond. xiii. 12,
11, 14, 24, 15, 10 3 LB. 467-9‚ 471—2‚ 475). He was appointed one of Henry's cup-
bearers (Brewer iii, p. 1540), but returned at the end of the year (ibid. 590—1‚ 598)
to marry a sister of William of Croy (p. 68) 3 an engagement which had been
in contemplation for one of his brothers since 1515 (Brewer ii. 160, etc.), but was
still not completed in Sept. 1520 (id. iii. 992). Ηο had probably returned
to England in the interval, since he received from Henry two half-year's wages
(ibid. pp. 1540,2). By the death of the last of his brothers in July 1525, he
became heir to the title (id. iv. 1488), and was advanced to something of his
father’s position and influence, being created Kt. of the Golden Fleece in Dec.
1531, and, after his father's death, Marquis of Bergen in May 1533. In 1532
Hubert Barland dedicated to him a medical Velitatio, Antwerp, H. Petri. See
Goethals ii, s. Glymes, and de Reiffenberg.]

ERASMVS ANTONIO SVO S. D.

Lautam ferinam eleganti epistolio commendans munus muneri
cumulasti ; neque enim illa palato suauior quam hoc animo. Nimi-
rum hoc est quod docuit Esiodus, αὐτῷ τῷ μέτρῳ καὶ λώιον. Age, mi
Antoni, perge in huiusmodi venari saltibus ; perge veterem illam et

iam pridem obsoletam principum gloriam reuocare, gentisque Ber· ·

ganae per se clarissimas imagines accessione litterarum reddere
clariores, fortuneque decus ingenii tui decore conduplicare. Felices
litterae si summatibus viris placere coeperint ; sed feliciores ipsi, si
veris ac propriis ornamentis sese reddiderint suspiciendos. Ex
Caesare germanam illam Romani sermonis puritatem disces ; sed
caue ne ex eodem ambitiosam bellandi discas insaniam. Aduersus
hoc antidoti vice te premuniet noster De Principe Christiano libellus 3
et historiam magis percipies, si cosmographiam praegustatis.

Bene vale, et Aelium te discipulo felicissimum reddito feliciorem:
erit enim hoe felicior quo tu doctior ae melior euaseris. De me nihil
aliud polliceor quam quod tuus ex animo et sum et futurus sum.
