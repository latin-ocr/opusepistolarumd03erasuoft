London.
19 August (1517).

[Ammonius’ death can be dated in 1517 from Ep. 642 and many other letters.
From evidence now available it is possible to decide between 17 and 18 Aug. as
the precise day (cf. Ep. 218 introd.). On 17 Aug. he signed his will (Knight,
Life of Οοῖθΐ, p. 213), presumably at westminster. A letter from Vannes (p. 76)
to Wolsey states that his death occurred, after twenty hours’ illness (ef. Ep. 639.
22 n.) at 9 p.m. (hesterna nocte hora nona3 Brewer ii. 3602. Cf. also Ep. 624).
This must have been 17 Aug. ; for his death was known to Foxe at St. Oross, by
Winchester, on 18 Aug. ; when he wrote to Claymond, President of Corpus
Christi College‚ Oxford, informing him of the fact, and conferring upon him the
living of Bishop's Cleeve, in Gloucestershire, which he had given to Ammonius
only fifteen days before, on a vacancy also arising through the sweating-sickness
(Orig. letter at C.G.C.). It may be noted that Ammonius' canonry at West-
minster was filled with almost equal promptitude‚ being conferred by Henry
upon Linacre on 19 Aug. (Brewer ii. 3624). And the purpose of Vannes‘ letter
cited above <clearly 18 Aug.) is to ask for one of Ammonius' benefices.]

to abandon his hopes at Louvain and
take Mosellanus' place at Leipzig,
whither he travelled through Basle
(Lond. xx. 27-31 ; LB. 736-9‚ 787) but
not Nuremberg (Lond. xxx. 41, LB.
7403 but cf. Heumann, p. 213). He
matriculated at Leipzig in the summer
of 1525, but on 1 (Sept. ‘?> he left (see
EHE. p. 42 3 Hartfelder, Melanchth.
Paedayoy. p. 26 ς and Heumann, p. 214),
perhaps as being suspected of Luther-
anism (Lond. xxx. 44, LB. 823). He
next returned to Tournay (cf Ep. 616.
14 11.) ; but in Dec. 1526 had left, and
had been some monthsin Holland(Basle
MS. Goelenii Epist, f. 25²). In Nov.
1527 116 was perhaps with Goelen at
Louvain (ibid. f. 5v0), and in Feb. 1528
Erasmus was trying to procure his re-
turn to Leipzig (EE. 83). In April he
was living with Eicholtz (Ep. 866) at
Cologne (Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 24. 130) ; and
there was talk of making him professor
there (Krafft, p. 165). In 1529 Soter
published for him De sono literarum prae-
sertim Graecarum, with a preface to
Erasmus ; an essay on the ‘ Erasmian '

pronunciation of Greek. After a false
report of his death in 1529 (ΕΕῙΖ 75),
he died at Louvain, and was buried in
the Franciscan church, being described
on his tomb as ‘presbyter Deo deuotus’.
He translated into Latin two books of
Chrysostom De sacerdotio, Antwerp,
M. Hillen, 1526 (Maittaire ii. 673) ;
and at his suggestion Martens printed
two sermons of Gregory Nazianzen in
Greek, s.a.

See Sweert3 Foppens; Neve, Renais·
sance en Belyique, pp. 200-33 and EE.
He is not to be confused with J as.
Theodorici of Hoorn, to whom Ep. 940
is addressed.

622. 32. composita lite] The Papal
commission had declared in Reuchlin’s
favour, 2 J uly 15163 but at Hochstrat’s
request Leo x had postponed action.
He did not give judgement till 23 June
1520 — against Reuchlin. See Geiger,
