James Banisius or de Bannissis (1466—0. 1534) was born on the island of
Curzola in Dalmatia. In 1506 he was an apostolic protonotary at Rome. By
1509 he had become an Imperial Secretary (Le Glay i. 303), and soon attained to
influence in Maximilian⁷s court ; where the English diplomatists regarded him
as favourable to themselves (Brewer ii). He was frequently detached for
special service ; as in Sept. 1510 to France, in Sept. 1513 to the English camp at
Tournay (Brown ii. 331, 2), and in Aug. 1517 to Charles at Middelburg (1. 2n.).
In 1512 he received the deanery of Trent ; and in 1513 that of Antwerp, on the
Pope’s presentation. But the contest with the nominee of the Chapter, Adrian
of Utrecht, prevented him from enjoying this latter till 1516. In Feb. 1518 he
went to Paris, to visit Faber Stapulensis, and then to Basle (BRE. 74), perhaps
on his way to Trent, where he was in Sept. 1519. On Maximilian's death he
entered the service of Margaret of Austria. In Aug. — Sept. 1520 Diirer found
him at Brussels and at Antwerp, and drewa charcoal pertrait of him: see
Diirer's Literary Remains, ed. W. M. Conway, 1889, pp. 101, 103-4. He was on
diplomatic service again at Milan in 1523-4 (Heumann, p. 143), and at Rome in
1525 (Bergenroth iii. 1. 153, 261). In 1529 he obtained the appointment of his
nephew, of the same name, as his coadjutor in the deanery of Trent3 and in
