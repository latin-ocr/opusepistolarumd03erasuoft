879. To CHRISTOPHER ESOHENFELDER.

Louvain.
19 October 1518.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 21.

Ε. p. 48: F. p. 219: HN: Lond. iv. 5: LB. 339.

[In the MS. the copyist (Hovius 211¹) is corrected by Erasmus (αἳ).

Christopher Eschenfelder was eustoms-officer for the Abp. of Treves at Boppard.
The tie now formed (cf. Ep. 867. 46-55) lasted through Erasmus' lifetime. To
friends travelling down the Rhine he often afterwards gave letters of introduc-
tion to Eschenfelder; and in response to a request dedicated to him the De puritate
Ecclesiae (M), which is an exposition of Psalm 14 (15). See EE. 92, 177, 215, 219,
and BRE. 319. It appears from Hontheim‚ Hist. Treuirensz's, 1750, ii. 701, that
Eschenfelder was still in office at Boppard in 1544. Diirer (Licerary Romaim,

ed.JVVl. M. Conway, 1889, p. 95) was well treated by him, when passing Boppard
24 u y 1520.

CHRISTOPHORO ESCHENVELDIQ TELONAE POPARDIENSI.

S. P. Quid tam praeter spem euenit quam quod Cinicampianum
nostri studiosum Bobardie repperi? imo telonen Musis honestisque
studiis addictum? Christus in probrum Phariseorum vertit quod
meretrices et publicani praecederent eos in regnum coelorum. An
non eque dedecorosum quod sacerdotes et monachi per luxum et 5
ocium ventri viuunt‚ dum telonae bonas litteras amplectuntur?
Illi se totos gule consecrant, Cinicampianus se Cesari studiisque

partitur.

Satis pre te ferebas quam de nobis opinionem concepisses.

Preclare mecum agitur si nihil ab ea detriuit noster conspectus.

879. m. add. αἳ.
Ep. 889. 11.

From 1510 until his death he was
Prior of the Carmelites at Louvain;
except for an interval in 1517-8, when
he was Prior at Brussels. In 1520
Charles v appointed him Inquisitor.
I-Ie was one of the most obstinate
oppononts of Erasmus3 who in con-
sequence detested him. Their en-
counters perhaps began in 1516 (Ep.
483. 26) after the appearance of the
Nouum Instrzaementum3 and thencefor-
ward he is frequently the object of
scornful reference as ‘Camelus' or
‘Camelita ' in Erasmus' writings. His
attack on a translation in the second
edition of the New Testament called
forth Erasmus’ Apol. de loco ‘Omnes
quidem resuraemus' c. 1521, in which
there is a description of him (LB. ix.

annm< 111

1. S. P. om. E.
9. noster a: nostri H.

2. Bobardie a: Popardiae E. Cf-

434); and he detected heresy in four
passages added to the Colloquiorum For-
muhze, Basle‚ Froben, March 1522 (see
BErss. Colloq. i. pp. 105—9). Against him
Erasmus invoked the protection of the
Rector of Louvain in 1520, and later of
Adi-ian vt and Margaret of Austria.
He was also the butt of many lampoons
from Erasmus’ friends ; the grossest
being N esen's letter about tho Masters
of Louvain and the Vita S. Nicolaz’
(Zw. E2. 111). Erasmus often writes
his name, as here, Edmondanus.
