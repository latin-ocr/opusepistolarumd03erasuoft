[1518

872. To JOHN LANG.

Gotha MS. chart. A. 399, f. 222.
Horawitz ii. 2.

Louvain.
1 7 October (1518).

[This letter is found in a ms. volume, now in the Ducal library at Gotha,
which was written by Siegfried Asterius of Hildesheim. The volume is a folio
of 277 leaves, and its contents are mainly copies of letters to John Lang. These
were probably made by Asterius 0. 1553 from the originals in the possession of
Martin Seidemann. Dean of the Saxon College at Erfurt, who had married
Lang’s daughter3 but unfortunately his work is by 110 means accurate. See
G. Oergel in Mitt. cl. Vereins s. d. Gesch. . . . von Effurt, xv (1892), pp. 18-9.

John Lang or Lange (†c. 3 April 1548) of Erfurt matriculated there in the
winter of 1500—1, and was B.A. 1503. In 1510 he entered the house of Austin
Friars, of which Luther was an inmate (cf. LE2. 6, MRE2. 490). In 1511 he was
sent to lVittenberg, where he was M.A. 10 Feb. 1512 and came to know Staupitz
gl. 4 n.). He remained there teaching till 1516, Greek being one of his subjects
(LEss. 14 ; cf. JE. 22, ME. 72 and Krafft p. 150) 3 and Grunenberg printed for him
during this period an edition of the Enchiridion of Sextus, Nov. 1514, and two
letters of Jerome c. June 1515, one being Ep. 70 in defence of humane learning.
By May 1516 he had returned to Erfurt and become Prior of the Austin Friars
(MRE2. 560 = LE2. 14, cf. 15), and Eobanus and Jonas were among his pupils
QJE. 21). He was D.D. at Erfurt 14 Feb. 1519 (JE. 22), but was gradually drawn
over to reform. In 1521 Maler published for him at Erfurt an Apoloyia on behalf
of a priest who had married3 a translation of St. Matthew’s Gospel into German
out of the Greek, aided by Erasmus' version ; and a defence of his theologieal
position, addressed to the Rector of the University (Panzer vi. 501). In 1522 110
left the Augustinians (LE2. 504; cf. ME. 114), and in 1524 married (LE2. 876),
remaining in Erfurt as one of the Evangelical preachers. By May 1528 his wife
was dead, and he quiokly married again (LE2. 13192, 1556). In his later years
he was the acknowledged head of the Reformed Chureh in Erfurt; and both
Melanchthon and Jonas address him as its ¹ Bishop ⁹.

INTEGERRIMO PATRI D. IOANNI LANGO, THEOLOGO INSIGNI.

Bom consulas, theologorum candidissime, si me vincis epistola,
modo ne cedam amore. Nam offendit nos Hessus, homo dotibus
omnibus cumulatissimus, primum aegrotum, deinde occupatissimum.
Staupitium vere magnum adamo, sycophantas istos iam olim negligo ;
quid enim aliud faciam ? Quasi vero debeam istis conscientiae meae
rationem reddere! Mihi satis est quod episcopis omnibus placeo,
quod theologorum primis ac optimis. Si quod vitae genus viderem
in quo crederem Christo magis placiturum, protinus amplecterer3
nam animum meum iam nec fama nec pecunia nec voluptas nee

vitae cupiditas tenet.
4. vere scripsi: vero MS.

 

 

4. Staupitium] John Staupitz (e. 114—5‚ 117-8. When the confiict over

1465 — 28 Dec. 1524), the wise Vicar-
General of the Austin Friars, who
steadied Luther and in 1508 brought
him to teach at Wittenberg. In 1512
he resigned his chair of theology to
Luther, and spent some years in
travelling on business of his order.
For the success of his preaching at
Nuremberg 111 Advent 1516 see SE.

indulgences began, Staupitz used all
his influence for moderation; and in
1520 resigned his vicariate rather than
act against Luth er, though by no means
approving of his course. From 1522
until his death he was Abbot of
St. Peter’s at Salzburg. See LE.; a
study by L. Keller, 1888 ; Creighton v 3
