93-8] FROM WOLFGANG FABRICIUS ΟΑΡΙΤΟ 527

Ep. 933. 18). It is therefore probable that Capito's letter was called forth by
Erasmus' action in deterring Froben from printing Luther's books3 see Ep.
904. 19 n., and cf. especially Lond. xxi. 7, LB. 718.]

MARTINI, obsecro, negotium in publicum nihil eleues. Nosti
quantum valet calculus tuus. Ex animo loquor. Expedit superesse
famam Lutherio. Dabitur animus reliquae iuuentuti vt aliquid

audeant pro libertate Christi: quanquam ipse multa in eo desidero.

Curato Louanium ne obsit. Nos tibi in officio continebimus 5

Germaniam et Saxoniam‚ vbi Princeps potens Lutherii patronus
et florentissima Academia Wittembelgensis, tot illustres viri qui
ex aequo fauent Erasmo et Lutherio. Nihil in votis potius habent
aduersarii quam tuum in illum stomachum videre. Tibi cum suis
addictissimus est. Omnes praestat infestos habere theologos quam
illius propugnatores3 sunt enim principes aliqui, cardinales,
episcopi, et clarissimi quique ecclesiasticorum, quibus cordi est
negotium.

9392·ae To DUKE FREDERICK or SAXONY.

Weimar MS. Reg. N. 156, f. 3. Antwerp.
14 April 1519.

[An original in the Hauptstaatsarchiv at Weimar (α) ; autograph throughout.
It was printed not long after it was written, in a pamphlet without printer's
name <?Leipzig, M. Lotther) containing the questions on which Eck and
Carlstadt were to dispute at Leipzig on 27 June 1519 (β). The Breslau Town
Library has a contemporary ms. copy by two hands (γ), which seems to be
based on α ; but its variants are unimportant. The text g1ven in Luther's Opera,
wittenberg‚ J. Lufft, 1545, vol. i. f. 236 (δ), has some points of contact with α.

Besides the original the Weimar Archiv also possesses a copy of a German
letter from Erasmus to Duke Frederick (f. 7 in the same volume> ; in Spala-
tinus' hand and endorsed by hirn. The German is not a version of the Latin
for besides omitting Luther altogether, it deals with the remaining subject-
matter quite differently, mentioning (l. 5³> what is not otherwise known,
a letter from the Duke acknowledging the dedication of Suetonius. The
date also is a few days later, 18 April from Louvain. Spalatinus' authority is,
however, amply sufficient to establish the genuineness of the German ; aud the
same volume at lVeimar affords a parallel case, Erasmus’ letter to Duke John
of Saxony in 1526 being accompanied by a German text—more of a translation,
but with a similar slight variation in date—the authenticity of which is
attested by an autograph addi-ess in Erasmus' hand. The omission ot· Luther
in the German letter here perhaps indicates that in the interval, 14-8 April,
Erasmus had heard of Frederick's protection of Luther (LE2. 117). It may be
noticed that Ep. 963 replies to the Latin letter.

This had been seen at Wittenberg, 21 May, by Melanchthon and Luther (ME.
42, LE². 187) ; at Leipzig, 3ο May, by Mosellanus (Th. Kolde, Analecta Mamertina,

1883, P· 8) 5 at Heidelberg, 30 July‚ by Bucer (BRE. 119) ; and in all cases gave
great satisfaction]

SALVTEM ac felicitatem, illustrissime Princeps. Tametsi mihi
nunquam contigit illustrissimam celsitudinem tuam intueri coram

DURCHLAUCHTIGSTER Furst vnd gnedigster Herr, fur mein Trewmeynung
