To ANTONY CLAVA.

Louvain.
29 April (1518).

[There is no difficulty in identifying the Journey here contemplated with the
visit to Basle; cf. also 1. 1 n. In 1519, the only other year possible, the visit to
Antwerp which Erasmus made about this season‚ would not have been so

sure to yield another Herodotus]

. . liber, a D. Erasmo

Roterodamo diligenter recoywzitus ac emendatus: id quod ipse testatur suo in liminari hae
pagina episfozio, Cologne, E. Cei-vicorum, ε. α. (a); a work which narrates the

martyrdom of the seven Maccabaean brothers and their mother.

Besides

the J osephus the volume contains a letter to Marcaeus dated 5 June 1517, from
Fr. Magdalius Iacobus Gaudensis, a Cologne Dominican (1469-1520), and also
some extracta from the Fathers and other ancient authors about the martyrs.
Helias Marcaeus was warden of 3 convent of Benedictine nuns at Cologne‚
which took its name from the possession of relies of the Maccabaeans brought
from Italy by Abp. Reinold Dassel of Cologne (†1167) ; see GC. iii. 772‚3. Little
seems to be known of Marcaeus beyond that he restored the nuns’ church

in 1504

; and that in 1524 Erasmus sent him the Comparatio viminis et martyris,

composed 011 behalf of the nuns in response to frequent presents of sweetmeats.

seen Glava on his way to or from Bruges
3 fortnight or so earlier; cf. Ep. 831.

Herodotum] The copy given by
Erasmus to clava, the Aldine edition
of Sept. 1502, was in the possession of
the late Mr. J. Ε. Hodgkin. At the end
is 311 inscription by Levinus Ammonius,
one of Erasmus' later servant-pupils,
referring to this letter and stating that
the book was bequeathed to him by
Clava on his death, 31 May 1529. See

alius] The copy bought by Eras-
mus to replace his gift is now in the
British Museum (C. 45. k. 6) ; the same
edition, bound up with the Aldine
Pausanias, J uly 1516. A letter from Dr.
Sieber to Dr. Garnett, 6 Dec. 1890, shows
from the Basle MS. 0. VII. 19 that this
must be the ‘Herodotus et Pausanias
graece Aldi’ which passed to John a
Lasco at Christmas 153} under the com-
pact made with Erasmus in 1525; cf.
Miaskowski‚ Kar-respondem des Erasmus
