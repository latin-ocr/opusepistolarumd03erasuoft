9²74] FROM LONGOLIUS ΤΟ LUCAS 473

to study. On Bembo's return to Rome, he went to Padua, 18 April 1520, and
there the remaindcr of his life was spent in increasing poverty‚ assisted at times
by various friends, one of whom was Reginald Pole. Even a Ciceronian oration
against the Lutherans failed to bring him support, though composed at Papal
request (Lo. E.‚ f. 108). It was first printed in Lo. E.‚ but there is a ms. copy
at Basle (A. IX. 72) made by Boniface Anien-bach at Avignon, 29 Aug. 1523.

Longolius' direct relations with Erasmus began with this letter, which seems
to have been sent by Lucas to Ruze, perhaps as Longolius' former patron, and
was by Ruzc communicated to Erasmus (Ep. 935. 7), evidently at a meeting
which followed Epp. 926, 928. Hence the year-date can he assigned. A letter
from Longolius to Budaeus, 31 Aug. (1520) (Lo, E., f. 75) shows that Erasmus
printed this letter here without consulting the writer. Their meeting at Louvain,
instead of promoting cordiality, only accentuated the two points of difference
raised here and in Ep. 935. Erasmus considered his visitor engrossed in the
trifles of Ciceronianism3 his patriotic feelings, too, had doubtless been some-
what wounded by this letter, and they were further offended by Longolius’ per-
sistent adherence to Plance—though Erasmus still regarded him as a Brabantine
(cf. LB. i. 1016A with ll. 89, 90 here), and had not- yet formed the opinion that
he was a Hollander (Lond. xxvii. 38, LB. 1284). Their disagreement continued
aster Longolius’ death ; for though Erasmus wrote of him then with propriety,
it was' suspected that the character of Nosoponus in the Ciceronianus was drawn
from Longolius (cf. Lond. xxiii. 10, LB. 1008), and in spite of the appreciative
criticism later (LE. i. 1016-9) this provoked violent attacks on Erasmus in
Longolius’ defence from J. C. Scaliger and Dolet.

James Lucas had been Dean of Orleans since 1510. He was in Rome at this
time, on an embassy to secure the canonization of St. Francis de Paul. See GC.
viii. 1509 and Actes (Ie Fraucoz‘s 1⁹⁷2 ix. 58. Beraldus dedicated to him a Metaphrasz‘s
of Aristotle's Oeconomics, Paris, J. Bal-bier (1514 or 1515), see Delaruelle in

Rev. cl. Bibliothe'ques xii, 1902, pp. 435,6.
Besides the series of Erasmus* Epistolae this letter was included with Ep. 935

in an edition of Longolius' works‚ Basle, J. Valder‚ Sept. 1533 (a), at the end of
the fifth book of letters (p. 342). But as the readings of α 111 both cases agree
with those 01·H‚ except in one trifling omission (l. 48), it was presumably taken
from that source, and may follow H among the sigla]
