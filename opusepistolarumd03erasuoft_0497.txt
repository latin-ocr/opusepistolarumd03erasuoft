nihil eo opus fuisset: habes animum meum tibi deditissimum. De

schedula remissa audi, quaem, quid acciderit.

Venit germanus tuus

ad nos, pulsitat fores; ego continuo accurro, rogo quid velit; is quod 5

miseras tradit.

Dominus forte fortuna, cum aperio hostium, hunc

tuum vidit. Rogat num literas ad eum deferendas receperim. Nihil

tale accepisse me respondeo.

Rursum ille quid negocii mihi cum eo.

Ego hesitabundus quod omnium pessimum respondeo miser ; nempe

schedulam quam tibi communicaueram recepisse.

Is continuo 10

excandescit et m1serum me suis fulminibus, hoc est blandis verbis,
ferme exanimasset, nisi nouissem hominem. Non quod tibi com-
municatum non volebat, sed de caeteris similiter fecisse me

affirmabat.

Quod nisi plane stupidus fuissem, aliud mihi in mentem

venisset, vel de praeculis Graecis vel ex tripode quiduis iniecissem. 15
Quare te oro, mi D. Martine, apud te serues: nullius momenti res
est, sed quia ita D. vult, acquiescere non indecorum voluntati eius
putaui. Caue tamen ne quisquam resciscat quod haec tibi scripserim ;

quare lectas Vulcano committas velim.
inuiserit‚ caue mentionem istius feceris.

Dominus meus si quando te
Bene vale. Ex Lilio. 20

Louvain.

(c. December) 1518.

[Not long after Erasmus’ return to Louvain3 for it is clear that Glareanus,
when writing to him, had not yet heard that he had left Basle. In view of
(he points of resemblance to Ep. 905, the two letters are probably not far apart

in date.]

903. 2. Frobenius] Jerome Froben
(6 Aug. ¹501—13 March 1563), the
printer’s eldest son, by his first wife,
was the first child born at Basle
after the town had joined the Swiss
confederation. He matriculated at
the university in 1515, soon after
Oeeolampaffius, and therefore about
Michaelmas. On the present visit to
Louvain he became servant-Pupil to
Erasmus; returning to Basle in July
(BRE. 416). After another visit in the
autumn (BRE. 132) he was admitted
by his father to the business, his name
appearing in the colophon to Erasmus’
Paraphrases on Rom. Cor. Gal„ Jan.

to Chur and received from Ant. Pucci

who later advised him to apply himself
to his work (Lond. xvii. 21, LB. 588).
On 7 Jan. 1524 he married Anna
Lachner (Basle MS. G. II. 13. 1403
cf. G. ΙΙ. 29 fin.). who was his step-
mother's sister (BRE. 157). He con-
tinued to work with his father, visiting
Italy in May 1526 in quest of MSS.
(Lond. xxi. 35, 39, LB. 81677: EE2. 42).
On John Froben's death he continued
printing with John Herwagen (Sept
1528-—March 1531) his stepmother's
second husband, and Nicholas Episco—
pius (Sept. 1529-1563) who had married
his stepsister. In June 1531 he bought
