[Erasmus (11²) has again corrected his copyist (al) ; Hand C, Nepos.

Hermann Busch or van dem Busche (1468 —- April 1534) was born 111 the castle
of Sassenberg, E. of Miinster. On the advice of Rud. Langen he was sent
to Deventer and was for a while a pupil of Hegius. In 1484 he went to Heidelberg
and heard Agricola. Between 1485—90 he was in Italy studying under Pomponius
Laetus at Rome. After a period in the household of the Bp. of Miinster, he began
in 1494 to lecture at Cologne 3 but in the winter went off to Bologna‚ where he
matriculated c. Jan. 1495 (ANGB. p. 247, MRE2. ii, p. 370). 011 8 Oct. 1495 he
matriculated at Cologne, but before long wandel-ed off, teaching and ensuing
humanism in many towns of N. Ger-many with ardent conviction. From 1501-8
he was at Leipzig (cf. TE. i. 59), except for an interval, Oct. 1502- May 1503,
during which he was Reader 111 Poetry at the newly founded university of
Wittenberg. From Leipzig he returned to Cologne, where Glareanus was his
pupil; and remained for some year-S, until he began wandering again, to
Holland and England in 1516, to Wesel, where he became master of the town-
school, in 1517 : returning to Cologne just at this time (Ep. 808. 2).

Erasmus met him at Frankfort in March 1515 (cf. Ep. 967. 72 n.; not at
Mainz, as stated in Ep. 300. 12 11.); 31111 111 1516 Busch composed a poem for
Erasmus' entry into Cologne (Epp. 440. 14 n., 463, 490), which was printed in C¹
and subsequent editions of the Epistolae. In Sept. 1518 they met again at Spires
(Epp. 867, 877), Busch being perhaps domiciled at Cologne (Ep. 866); and shortly
afterwards Erasmus tried to secure him for the Collegium trilingue at Louvain
(Ep. 884). 111 June 1520 Busch writes from VVorms (Lond. xii. 14, LB. 513) 3
where they met again in Nov. 1521 (Lond. xxiii. 6, LB. 650). 111 Aug. 1520,
when at Basle staying with Froben, he contributed a let-ter to Elsv.⁷ and some
verses about Lee ⁶ non secus 30 Baby negligendo (Env. pp. 171-5) : on
28 Sept. 1520 Spalatinus (Annale83 cf. p. 497) met him at Cologne. In 1521 (OE.
i, p. 33) and in April 1522 (Zw. E2. 204) he was again at Basle, and came into the
circle of the Reformers (Zw. E2. 199) ; 31111 thenceforward his interests turned to
theology rather than humanism. From 1526—33 he taught in the new Reformed
university at Marburg; but then returned to Westphalia‚ where. he died at Dulmen.

He composed numerous works for the advancement of education and learning ;
the most not-able being his Vallum hmnanitatis, Cobgne, Nic. Caesar, 12 April 1518,
a defence of the studies to which he had devoted his life, showing their impor-
tance for the progress 01 theology.
