ΤΟ THOMAS MORE 5

Sollicitus essem quibus verbis illi gratias agerem, ille vltra quin-
quaginta scutatos Gallicos addidit, nec vlla ratione licuit excusare.
Dispeream si quid habet hec etas cum eo viro conferendum. Petrus 20
Aegidius haud satis prospera valetudine etiamnum est 3 sepe relabitur
et timet nescio quid, quod diuino magis quam scio, quod sane nolim
accidere. onr illius a reditu meo ex Anglia abortiuit, opinor mariti

periculo expauefacta.

Louam‘um commigraui totus, cum theologis aliquot menses acturus, 25

qui me satis benigne acceperint. Pensionis partem de suo soluit
Cancellarius, hoc est ducentos florenos, eam pecuniam arte quadam

reparaturus.

Centum adhuc expecto: sed quis hanc numerabit

omnibus digressis? Cancellarius supremis verbis iussit me optimo

esse animo. Destinauit, vt intelligo, mihi episcopatum. Adeo facilius 30

est istis episcopum facere quam promissam pecuniam soluere.

Faber amicus haud admodum amice mecum egit in proxima editione
Epistularum Apostolicarum ; odiosius enim tuetur suam sententiam, Ι
arrodens etiam nonnulla que ad ipsius causam nihil attinebant. Ilico

20. Disperiam MS.
33. enim scripsi: etiam MS.
attinebat MS.

18. vltra] ‘In addition to his ser-
vices with the New Testament’; not
supra, as in Ep. 296. 126, 129. But
perhaps varo should be read3 for
Erasmus habitually lays great stress
on the spontaneity of gifts made to
him; cf. 1. pp. 42-5, Epp. 295. 23-5‚
296. 126-30.

quinquaginta] Probably the sum
mentioned in Ep. 651 as received by
Erasmus at Bruges.

26. Pensionis] as Councillor3 cf.
Ep. 565. 12 n. The amount now due
to Erasmus was 300 florins (cf. Epp.
628. 49, 695. 36), of which Le Sauvage
advanced him 200 at Ghent (cf. Ep.
621. 9 n.‚ 11). The third hundred was
sent by Barbirius from Lille (Ep. 621)
after collection of money due from
some Spanish agent3 and reached
Erasmus at Louvain through do Mar-
ques between 17 July (Ep. 608. 7) and
0. 1 Aug. (Ep. 616. 1 ; cf. Epp. 651,
695); but this included 65 from his
pension at Courtray (Epp. 613, 621).

30. episcopatum] Of. Ep. 475. 4 n.

32. Faber] In the Nouum Instru-
mentum Erasmus had criticized some
remarks made by Faber 011 Hebr. 2 in
his Commentaries on the Epistles,
Paris, H. Stephanus, c. 25 Dec. 1512.
In his second edition, Paris, F. Reg-
nault, 1517, which reached Erasmus

23. aboruit MS.
34. arrodens LB, cs. Ep. 607. 7: errodens MS.

28. expecto LB: ex pacto MS.

just at this time (cf. Epp. 731, 755, '

and Apol. ad Iac. Patr-um, LB. ix. 17 Α),
Faber had replied at length, ff. 182 νῦ-
185 v⁰; and though he had spoken of
Erasmus with the utmost admiration
and affection, testifying his desire to
seek only the truth and to avoid all
offence, he unfortunately allowed him-
self (f. 183) to describe 0110 of Erasmus’
opinions as impiouS. ‘Hunc ser—
monem, Christum scilicet non paulu-
lum imminutum fuisse a Deo, immo
infra abiectissimos etiam homines,
animose refutabimus tanquam impium
et Christo Deoque indignissimum.'
Erasmus replied hotly with an Apoloqia,
dated 5 Aug. 1517, resenting the charge
of blasphemy and deploring the pub-
licity of the controversy, which would
cause the foes of advanced theology to
rejoice; and in the notes, completed
23 Aug. 1518, to the second edition of
the New Testament (Ep. 864) 110 re-
capitulated his rejoinder under fifty-
seven heads (pp. 494—500)‚ protesting
with undiminished warmth against
the accusation of blasphemy. Faber
did not pursue the matter further.

Erasmus' note and Faber’s rejoin-
der are reprinted at the end of the
first edition of the Apoloqia, Louvain,
Th. ²Martens, s. α. (Aug. 1517). See
