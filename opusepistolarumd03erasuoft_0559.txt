13. Deberquino] Louis of Berquin,
near Abbeville (c. 1490 — 17 April
1529) was born at Passy, near Paris,
of a family connected with that of
Halewin (p. 62). He was educated at
Orleans, where he was intimate with
Bera1dus, perhaps as a pupil‚ and thus
came into contact with Badius3 who
in June 1512 dedicated to him vol. ii of
Politian's Opera, vol. i being addressed
to Beraldus. Badius also dedicated to
him Aulus Gellius in Sept. 1517 ; and
Beraldus his translation of Lucian’s
Muscae Erwomium and an edition of
Filelfo's Conuiuia, Paris, H. Faber, s. α.
Berquin had some ties with the Court ;
for Erasmus describes him as dear to
Francis 1 and as Praefect and Royal
Councillor (Lond. xxx. 44, LB. 823).
In May 1523 the Sorbonne suddenly
moved the Parliament of Paris to seize
his papers ; and as a result he was im-
prisoned till Aug„ when the King
ordered his release. His offence was
that he had begun to translate into
French writings by Luther and Eras-
mus3 including, of the latter, the
Querela Pacis (Ep. 603) and the Encomium
Matrimonii (Ep. 604. 10 n.), to which he
added later the Inquisitio de fide from
the Colloquia of March 1524, and the
Modus orandi Deum of Oct. 1524. On
20 May 1525 these were formally con·
demned by the Sorbonne; but never-
theless were printed about that time

by Simon Dubois (Herminjard 259,
n. 28). In Jan. 1526 112 was arrested
again, at the request of the Bp. of
Amiens ; propositions from his works
were condemned in March, and he was
kept in prison till N ov., when the
intervention of Margaret of Valois set
him at liberty. To retaliate 011 his
opponents he presented to the King,
9 J uly 1527, twelve propositions from
the works of Natalis Beda, the prota-
gonist of the Sorbonne, and demanded
that they should be adjudged heretical ε
but the magistrates refused to pro·
nounce. Despite entreaties from Eras-
mus he continued his provocative
career (EE. 89), and c. March 1529
was again a1·1·ested; and before any
news could reach Margaret at Blois, he
was hurriedly burnt at Paris.

Besides the works mentioned above
he also translated Erasmus’ Para·
phrase on St. Mark (LB. App. 335)
and the Enchiridion ; the latter printed
at Antwerp, M. Empereur, 1529, and
by Dolet at Lyons, 1542.

See Erasmus’ accounts of him in
Lond. xxx. 48, xxiv. 4, LB. 1048, 10603

i, pp. 40-6; E. and E. Haag, La France
protestante, ed. H. Bordier‚ ii. (1881)
