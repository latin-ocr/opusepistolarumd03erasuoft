771] To JOHN CAESARIUS 215

library ; written by Hand A (Phrysius) and corrected by Hand G (N epos).]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS IOANNI CAESARIO SVO S. P.

Qvnso te, Caesari candidissime, an non hoc est planissime quod
prouerbio diei soleat, ὥσπερ ὃ καικίας νέφοςί) [quod] cum ipse mihi
ceu meopte iumento labore laborem accersam. Primum Theodori
librum feceram Latinum, quo magis laborem detraherem Graecarum
litterarum auidis, simulque velut esca quadam allicerem quos eius 5
linguae difficultas deterrere videbatur. At isti iam allecti me rursus
ad aliud laboris pensum pertrahunt, et ideo me nouo labore putant
onerandum quod ipsis laborem ademerim. Primo donato secundum
librum efflagitant, idque veluti suo iure faciunt, quasi vero qui
ientaculo exceperit, protinus et prandium et merendam et coenam 10
debeat. Sed quid facias cum populus vrget‘? velis nolis, parendum
est. Spero breui fore vt iam adulti vegetique in hoc studiorum
genere meam operam non desyderent‚ verum ipsi sine cortice natent.
Bene vale.

772. To Roc-ER WENTFORD.

Deventer MS. 91, f. 32 v0. Antwerp.
LB. App. 286. 21 February (1518).

[The series of letters, Epp. 772-7 and 781—92‚ hang closely together. They
appear to bear two different dates3 but Ep. 785. 1 shows that the later group was
carried by the same messenger as the former. The explanation seems to be that
Erasmus, being at Antwerp in the middle of February (Ep. 789. 1), decided to
send John Smith to London on certain business, perhaps the collection of
his papers from Peter Vannes3 and for this purpose wrote a few short notes
(Epp. 772-6), one of which (Ep. 773) was to help Smith on his way. After this,
i. e. on or after 22 Feb„ letters reached him from England through Peter Meghen
and Francis Berckman3 the former, to judge from the language used of him
(Ep. 786. 43—5), bringing a packet of earlier date but having travelled so slowly
as not to arrive before Berckman. Both paekets appear to have contained letters
from Vannes.

On receipt of these Erasmus added postscripts to Epp. 774—5, and wrote another
letter to More (Ep. 785). He also decided to send letters to his English patrons
(Epp. 781, 783-4, 786) and friends (Epp. 777, 782, 787). These were written
gradually, one (Ep. 777) being composed at Antwerp and dated after his return
to Louvain ; where on 5 March he finally dispatched his messenger. Smith was
also the bearet of letters to friends whom he would pass and who would help him
forward, at Antwerp (Ep. 788), Bruges (Epp. 789,90)‚ Calais (Ep. 791) and
perhaps Dunkirk (Ep. 792).

The letters repeat one another so much that full crosa-references are unneces-
sary. Within the limits of their dates Ι have arranged them in such a way as
to show that in the work of copying Hand D may have preceded Hand G. The
former did the major part; Hand C’s only share being to add postscripts to
Epp. 774, 5, to complete Epp. 784‚5—beginning from iusto dolori (l. 24) and Non
desinent (l. 41)-and to copy Epp. 777 and 786-9. The inference suggested is
that. Hand C finished the copying, from Erasmus' rough drafts, after the departure
