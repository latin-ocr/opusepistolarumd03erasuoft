278 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 8

cum eo collocutus sum, sed non procul arbitris. Is te fert in oculis,
quae res vrit me maxime, cum eo quod aulici et Rex ipse ferre te
fama non cessant, vt ab eo audiui. Rex ex Italia Iustinianum
Episcopum ex Dominicali sodalitio accersendum curauit, et alium
Hebraice doctum, nomine, vt arbitror, Ritium: iamque habet vnum
Mithridatis aemulum, qui omnes pene linguas nouit, vt aiunt qui
hominem viderunt. Quum de iis me praesente sermonem ipse
faceret, egoque nonnihil, vt fit, dixissem: ⁴ Quidnam censes,’ inquit,
Budaee, de Erasmo‘? nostine quid 61 sit animi, et an in Franciam
tandem praemio se digno pertrahi possit?' ‘Si id’ inquam ‘cordi
magnopere Regi esse sentiS, odorari iterum non grauabor an adduci
Quando-
quidem si bene eum noui, ne episcopatum quidem opimum libens
mereat. vt inter aulicos agere incipiat ³. Ne multa: cum ei ad te vt
scriberet, ocium non suppeteret, autor mihi fuit vt animum tuum
explorarem, autorque tibi essem vt ad eum scriberes quid in animo
haberes, vt ipse negocium in aula procuraret. Agedum fastidiosule,
vide, consule, decerne an noster esse velis, ac delicias faceretandem
desine, vt vtar verbo comico. Dic quid tibi dari stipendii placeat vt
apud nos consenescas: cui mox sacerdotium accedet, vt ille arbitratur.
Si ad nos transire animum induxeris, multis, vt opinor, nostratium

356. Iustinianum] Agostino Gius-
tiniano (1470-1536) of Genea. He en-
tered the monastery of St. Apollinaris
at Pavia in April 1488, and after some
years there went to Bologna to study;
ultimately lecturing on Oriental lan-
guages. Through the influence of a
kinsman,Card. Sauli (cf. Ep. 607. 16n.),
he received the see of Nebbio in Cor-
sica, 11 Sept. 1514. In Nov. 1516 he
published a Psalterium octapzum, in Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, Arabic and Syriae,
Genoa, P. P. Porrus, with a dedica-
tion to Leo x3 and armed with this
went to Rome in quest of more prefer—
ment. After his cousin's disgrace in
1517 he accepted the invitation of
Francis 1 to become his almoner; and
for five years taught 111 Paris, making
a journey to England and Flanders in
the autumn of 1518 (cf. Brewer ii,
p. 1479), during which 116 visited Eras-
mus at Louvain (Epp. 877-8, 886). In
1520 he contributed prefaces to four
books printed by Badius3 and the
Nimes MS. 215 has a letter from him
(f. 169 νο) to de Pins (Ep. 928 n.) from
Paris, 18 Feb. 1521, referring to their
first meeting, at the conference between
Louis X11 and Ferdinand at Savona in
June 1507. In 1522 he withdrew to his

see, but in 1531 returned to Italy.

His writings include a translation of
Xenophon's Oeconomicus ; a description
of Corsica composed for Andrea Doria ;
and Annals of Genea, in Italian, ad-
dressed by him to the Senate in Aug.
1535, but not printed till 1537, after
his death at sea, through shipwreck, 011
his way to Corsica. His library 116
presented to the town of Genea. See
his autobiography in the Annali, ff.
223-53 Quetif and Echard ii. 96—1003
Renouard, Badius; and BE4.

Erasmus speaks slightingly of him
in the Apologia against Faber (LB. ix.
25 c), but subsequently regretted hav-
ing done so (Ep. 906. 481-7).

It was from the Psalterium octuplum
that Nic. Clenardus (Ep. 291. 107 11.)
made his first steps in Arabio. ,

358. Ritium] Perhaps Paul (Ep. 548.
15 n.), who from Antwerp may have
gone on into France.

vnum] M. Delarue'lle applies this
to Ritius ; but 'the description fits
Justinianus far better. The passage
about Ritius is perhaps a later insertion
by Budaeus.

360. ipse] Poncher.

372. comico] Plaut. Men. 381, Ροθπ.
280, 296.
