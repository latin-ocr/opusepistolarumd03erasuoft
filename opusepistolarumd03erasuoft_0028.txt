Α note among Dr. Knaake's papers has supplied the clue to solve the question
of Leclerc's relation to the Breslau MS. Rehdiger 254. In 1684 John Fecht, the
Director of the Ducal school at Durlach in Baden, published in his Hist. ecclesi·
‹csticcte seculi xvi supplementum. bk. viii, a collection of 53 letters. Of these 44 are
addressed to Erasmus and 1 is concerned with him: of the remainder 4 are
addressed to Nicholas Gerbell (Ep. 342 introd.)‚ 2 to Wolfgang Musculus, 1 to
Nicholas Episcopius, and 1 to John Papp. In his ‘Apparatus ' (p. 164) Fecht says
that he had received them from the library of Matthias Bernegger, the celebrated
Strasburg scholar (1582-1640), ‘ qui aliunde acceptas fideliter conseruauit.'
After the last letter he prints (p. 877) a colophon: ‘Praecedentes epistolas
Robertus Robertinus ex autographis plerasque descripsit, a Ioanne Pappo mecum
communicatis, qui Nicolai Gerbelii (cuius e bibliotheca haec veniunt) neptem
onrem habet. 1629. mense Martio.’

The correspondence of Bernegger printed by Dr. Reifferscheid (Briefe G. M. Lin-
qelsheims, M. Berneyyers und ihrer Fremee, 1889, 265, 268, 2933 and pp. 831, 844,
908-9) shows that the young Prussian scholar, Robert Roberthinus (1600-1648 ;
see ΑΕΒ), was staying with him in his ‘house at Strasburg in the winter of
1628-93 and thus it is clear that Bernegger was the author of the colophon
quoted, and that it was to him that John Papp (perhaps a son of the John Papp,
1549-161o‚ who was the leader of the Lutherans at Strasburg) lent the MSS.

The history of the Rehdiger MS. may thus be traced down to the present day.
Clearly Gerbell (†1560) had acquired it from Erasmus or his heirs. In March
1629 it was in the hands of Gerbell's granddaughter at Strasburg: by 1645 one of
the Rehdigers had purchased it and placed it in the Town Library at Breslau,
where it still is; the agent in the transaction being perhaps Roberthinus, who
probably made the Rehdigers’ acquaintance in 1622 (Reifferscheid, op. cit. 97. 71).

The relation of Leclerc‘s appendix to Fecht's book remains to be considered.
In quantity they are identical. Each has 43 letters from the Rehdiger MS. (one
of Leclerc's is in the body of the work, 1093) and 2 (LB. App. 325, 375) from
some other source. In both many of the letters are abridged, to exactly the
same extent. Leclerc's text, too, apart from inevitable depravations and one
conjectural amplification of a heading, appears to agree with Fecht’s. The
asterisk which he adds to these letters merely denotes that they had not been
included in earlier editions of Erasmus’ letters, The inference seems there-
fore to be plain that Leclerc derived them, not from the originals‚ but from
Fecht’s b00k; and further that the abi-idgment of the letters was done by
Roberthinus.

It is noticeable that some of Gerbell's papers were accessible to the Durlach
circle at about the same time3 cf. J. H. Maius’ Vita Reuchlini printed there
in 1687, p. 253 (quoted in HE. 21).
