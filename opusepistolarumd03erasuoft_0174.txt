delitescere. Ex motu tactuque rei foetide nil nisi foetor elici potest.

[Erasmus' paraphrases on the separate books of the New Testament may be
regarded as a natural sequence of his work upon the text. Paraphrase was to
him ‘a kind of commentary’ (Lond. xxiii. 63 LB. 650, 763 F): and the great
success of the introductory portions of the Nouum Instrumentum, the Paraclesis
and the Ratio verae theoloyiae (Ep. 745)-—a success which was doubtless personally
manifested to him before the long series of independent editions begins—sug-
gested to him the idea of an exposition of the New Testament in a popular
form. In this he would be free on the one hand from the restrictions of
a literal translation such as he had previously carried out⁷ and on the other
from the severities of a scholarly commentary, which he had discovered to be
less easy to him than paraphrase (Ep. 755) ε as indeed it was alien to his genius.
He began with the Epistle to the Romans3 and although strict orthodoxy
murmured, the book was on the whole so well received (cf. Ep. 937) that he
was encouraged to proceed through the various Epistles, first of st. Paul,
and then of the other Apostles. By 1521 these were completed3 and then at
the request of Schinner (Ep. 447. 596 n.) he turned to the Gospels, which he
finished in 1523. The Acts followed in 1524; and thus the whole New
Testament was paraphrased with the exception of the Revelati0n‚ to which
in this way he did not venture to lay his hand.

The fortunes of the work were never in doubt. Besides the numerous
editions published by Froben, the Paraphrases were reprinted, either wholly
or in part, in France, Germany, Switzerland‚ the Netherlands and Spain. By
1523 Leo Jud had translated those on the Epistles into German3 and in
1530 a German translation appeared of the Gospels and EpistleS. Of the
Paraphrase on St. Matthew a Bohemian version came out in 1542 ; and a French
version of the Epistles in 1543. Their success in England was even more
striking. Parts of Erasmus' translation of the New Testament had been turned
into English in 1538 and 1540. In 1543 with the support of Queen Katherine
Parr a number of scholars headed by Nicholas Udall undertook a complete
