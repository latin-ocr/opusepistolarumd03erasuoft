240⁴. FRoM WILLIAM WARHAM.

Deventer MS, 91, f. 108. Lambeth.
LB. App. 205. 11 November (1511).

[The severe cold mentioned in Epp. 665-9 led Leclerc into affixing the date
15173 and with Dr. Reich and Mr. Nichols I accepted this, though having the
advantage, which they had not, of knowing that the date is not in the manu-
script. But the probable identification of Hand A with John of Friesland
(cf. Ep. 637. 13 n.) precludes this date ; and indeed it is clear that this letter
should follow Ep. 240 in 1511. In that year Erasmus writes from Cambridge on
2 Nov. that he is coming to London on 1 Jan. and is suffering from a cold
(Ep. 238. 2-4, 143 cf. Ep. 239. 56-8). On 11 Nov. he refers to a ‘caluus nebulo'
(Ep. 240. 20 ; cf. Ep. 243. 7), whose return he is expecting‚ and who was probably
a letter-carrier3 and on 18 Nov. Ammonius writes of money coming from Warham
(Ep. 243. 17). In 1511, too, Warham was still Chancellor and would be found in
Westminster Hall.

Erasmus’ two letters to Warham are not extant, but they may probably be
dated 29 Oct. and 2 Nov.; the former being the one which More should have
delivered (cf. Epp. 240. 58, 243. 63—5).]

GVILIELMVS CANTVARIENSIS ARCHIEPISCOPVS ERASMO SVO S. D.

Poscr salutem. Binas a te accepi litteras, primas quidem et eas
prolixas in aula Westmonasterii‚ loco omni pleno ocio; quibus,
si earum lator postea comparuisset, libenter respondissem: alteras
vero quidam caluus, cuius caput vix vnicus crinis contegit, ad me
heri attulit ; quibus te pituita molestatum (de quo doleo) intellexi.
A quo malo vt citius liberari posses, misi impraesentiarum ad te per
praedictum tabellarium viginti angelos aureos ; inter quos Raphaelem
salutis medicum reperies, qui tibi mederi et pristinam restituere
sanitatem facile queat. Gaudeo ⁵te proximas Calendas Ianuarias
Lundinum, vt scribis, venturum. Cura vt valeas

Ex Lamhitha xi0 Nouembris.

Tuus Guilielmus Cantuariensis.
