gratulor 3 non est ille sui dissimilis, semper candidissime fauit bonae
spei ingeniis. Vtinam eum virum Deus iuuandis optimis studiis
quam diutissime superstitem esse velit! Tu fac, mi Glariane‚ te
modis omnibus instruas, vt nobis mox lampadem tradituris ita
succedas vt nomen Erasmi prorsus obscures. Bene vale. Saluta

ill of him (Q. p. 57), but nevertheless
in 1536 appointed him one of his
executors. Between Aug. 1538 and
May 1544 his first wife died and he
married Barbara Brand.

He had perhaps been at Cologne Univer-
sity (matric. 19 Dec. 1515) ; but by now
was studying in Paris. In July 1519 110
went to Louvain, and remained there
eight months, working with Erasmus
in the college du Lis (LE2. 284); his
residence being broken only by a visit
in Aug. 1519 to Paris, whence he fied
again because of the plague. In March
1520 he left Louvain by reason of
difficulties with the theologians‚ and
returned to Paris; where Gourmont

Chancellor of E. Friesland. With an
introduction from Vives (Goldast, Phil.
epist. centuria, no. 52) 110 made the
acquaintance of Brixius and Budaeus
(BE4. 67), and was able to act as go-
between in the dispute of Brixius with
More (Lond. xv. 9, LB. 609: (summer
1520)). He then went to Italy to
pursue his studies. During 1522 he
was four months 111 company with
Ursinus Velius (Ep. 548. 4 11.) at Perugia
and Rome (VZE. 23; cf. Lond. xxiii. 6,
LB. 650, 754 A), and in Aug. 1524 he
was at Padua (Lond. xxi. 4, LB. 689).
In Dec. 1525 he returned (see Redlich.
Zs. sl. berq. Gesclachrsvereins, xli, 1908,
p. 1 74) ; and by March 1528 had married
Anna⁷ daughter of Pompeius Occo (Ep.
485. 30 n.). In the autumn he made
his way to Mechlin (Lond. xx.74-5‚ LB.
986—7) ; and before long was appointed
a member of the Provincial Council
His
Occo enabled him
to supply his scholar-friends with
material from Agricola's library3 notes
on Seneca to Erasmus, a translation
from Lucian and a homily of Chry-
sostom to Rescius. On 29 Feb. 1532 he
was transferred to the Utrecht Cou ncil,
and was for some time 111 Ε. Friesland
(ΕΕ. 169 : p. 202. 20). In 1533 Goclen
sent greetings to him through Hoxvir
(Gabba-ma, Epist. clar. virorum, 1663,
no. 205). In May and Oct. 1534 he
visited Cleves (Wolters, Konr. v. Heres-
bach, p. 16) ; but c. 1539 he was ill with
angina, which perhaps caused his death
(Ag1·ic.‘-' p. 257). See EHR. xxi. 307-83
and an article in Jb. f. szsc u. Alter-
liimer zu Emclen, xviii (1913) pp. 119-23,

Ι owe much of this note.
