[John Maier (13 Nov. 1486 — 10 Feb. 1543) was the son of a peasant at Egg or
Eck 011 the Giinz‚ near Ottobeuren. After visiting the universities of Heidel-
berg 1498, Tiibingen 1499 (MA. 1500), Gologne Oct. 1501, he spent eight years at
Freiburg, 2 July 1502 — Oct. 1510 ; first in the Gharterhouse‚ where he worked
with Reisch (Ep. 308 introd.)‚ and then in the Bursa Pauonis, where he was the
leader of the moderns against the ancients. After his D.D. in 1510 he became
Professor of Theology 31 Ingolstadt‚ which remained his home for the rest of his
life. His earliest work there was all in the direction of progress ; 1115 1111111010115
writings on philosophy seeking to displace scholasticism by reversion to Aristotle,
and his theology showing 3 similar tendency. But with the outbreak of the
Reformation he was drawn into the defence of the orthodox religion3 waging
a ceaseless contest with Luther and other of the Reformers on points of doctrine.
His brilliancy won him success in debate, of which he was very fond, but not
popularity (ef. Ep. 911) ; especially after his publication of the bull against
Luther in 1520. Yet his support of the Papacy did not lead him further than
3 protonotaryship.

His relations with Erasmus were not pleasant. In the autumn of 1517 he had
appeared as a keen critic of the Nouum lustramentum (Heumann, p. ‘1633 SE. 155‘13
and it was perhaps the thought of these previous utterances that inspired the pro-
testations of respect in 11. 10, 1 12—4. Erasmus did not welcome the criticisms offered
here ; and though he contented himself with one reply‚ Zasius was moved to
take up the matter in an Apozoyetica Defensio, Basle. Froben, March 1519. In
later years Eck endeavoured after reconciliation; but Erasmus remained sus·
picious of him till the end (Lond. xxx. 80, 53, 56: LB. 1141, 1146, 1205).

At Ottobeuren (Ep. 395 intr-od.) he was a frequent visitor in his early years.
Two of his books, Bursa Ραυοηίε, Strasburg, M. Hupfuff‚ 1507, and a Funeral
Oration on Henry of Lichtenau, Bp. of Augsburg († 12 April 1517), Augsburg‚
S. Otmar, s. a., are dedicated to successive Abbots3 and he is one of Ellenbog's
correspondents.

In 1538 he composed an autobffigraphy, Epistola cle ratimze studiorum suorum,
which was published in 1543, shortly after his death. See a life by Th. Wiede-
mann, 1865, with 3 good itinerary and bibliography, and ADB. John Major, of
