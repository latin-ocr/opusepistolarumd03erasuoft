[This letter and Epp. 812, 837 are close together. The year-date 1518 assigned
by Reich is clearly correct, since Erasmus is at Louvain, after Philip of Bur-
gundy’s appointment to Utrecht (p. 14), and is preparing for a journey.

It appears that the Bishop had visited some place within such easy reach of
Louvain that Erasmus could contemplate going backwards and forwards in order
to interview him (cf. Ep. 812. 10, 1) ; probably Mechlin or Brussels.

This letter may be dated about 13 April ; for Ep. 812 shows (1. 14) that the

the diocese of Troyes. He was living

in Ruze’s house, completin g his un iver-
sity course (M.A. 1521) and working
for Badius ; who mentions him in the
preface to Politian's works, 20 Feb.
1519, as having translated the Greek.
As early as 1515 he had begun teaching
privately (cf. Badius’ preface to Raph.
Maffei's Grammatica, 21 Jan. 1515, dedi-
cated to him) ; and some notes by him
on the later books of Gaza’s Greek
grammar are incorporated in Val.
Curio's edition, Basle, Aug. 1523. By
1524 he had left Ruze’s house (BE1.
153). For many years he was a pupil
of Budaeus ; to whose Epistozae he wrote
some notes published by Badius in
1526. About the same time he had
begun to teach publicly (ΕΕ.2 52).
During 1526-8 he helped Badius to
produce editions of Longolius' Orationes,

In 1529 he entered the service of
Canossa as a teacher 3 but in Nov.
Francis 1 obtained his discharge with
a view to making him one of the pro-
fessors of Greek in the College de
Franco (cf. Omont in Rev. des e'cudes
qrecques. xvi, 1903, pp. 41 7- 19)—an office
which he held until his death.

In 1526 he began to correspond with
Erasmus; but in 1529 there was a
temporary estrangement over the treat-
ment of Budaeus in the Ciceronianus,
Tus-anus supporting his master. One
of Tusanus’ pupils was Lud. Regius, the
biographer of Budaeus ; see a letter to
Tusanus from Regius, dated J an. 1536,
Toulouse‚ p. 55 of G. Budaei vita, 1540.
