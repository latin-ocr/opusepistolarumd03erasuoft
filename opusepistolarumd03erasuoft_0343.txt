831. To -JOHN GROLIER.

Deventer MS. 91, ff. 14 (αβ) and 7 v0 (γ). Louvain.
D. p. 156: F. p. 149: HN: 1101111111. 17: LB. 312. 24 April 1518.

[There are three drafts of this letter in the Deventer letter-book, all by
the same hand (Neposz C). The first (α) evidently represents the letter
actually sent, Nepos (111) being corrected in a few places by Erasmus (αἳ).
The second (β) is an amplification of this, written round and over α, and
evidently intended for publication. That Erasmus’ corrections were made
in α 31111 1101 111 β is shown by the critical note on l. 101. Besides these
two there is a fair copy (7); but as it ends at opus esse (1, 78) and only
reproduees β with occasional variations of spelling and 3 few lapses, there is
little need to take note of it. I have disregarded a few cases in which Nepos,
in altering the position of a word for β, has forgotten to obliterate the word in
its original place. As in Ep. 333 and elsewhere, Ι have adopted the longer
form (Β) as the basis of the text.

The celebrated book-lover, John Grolier [1479 — 22 Oct. 1565), belonged tc·
a Veronese family settled in France since xiiic. He was born at Lyons, of which
his father was a prominent citizen, but little is known os him before 1510, when
he had already succeeded his father as Treasurer of Milan, during the first
French occupation, which lasted Oct. 1499 — May 1512. He held this office
again during the second occupati0n‚ Oct. 1515 — Nov. 1521. In Oct. 1516
(or ‘3 1520) 110 married into the influential family of B1·i‹;onnet; and in the
summer of 1518 he was summoned to France on business (BRE. 120 ; ef. BE‘. 24).
In March 1519 from Milan he sent Fr. Asulanus a copy of Budaeus' De Asse to be
reprinted (Vat. MS. Reg. 2023, f. 196). By Sept. 1522, when the edition appeared.
he had become Treasurer to the Forces ; and he still held that office in 1531. In
1534 he was sent as ambassador to Rome; but on return reverted to finance.
rising to be Treasurer of France in 1539, when Francis 1 resumed his scheme for
building the College de France, and Treasurer—general in 1547.

His patronage of literature brought him many dedications, from Aldus,
Musurus, Egnatius, Fr. Asulanus‚ Caelius Rhodiginus‚ Beatus Rhenanus and
others 3 and his name is also famous for the care which he bestowed on binding
31111 keeping his treasures. See a monograph by Le Roux de Liney, 1866, which
gives documents and also notes of his books.

Grolier sent a reply to this letter, and Calvus (l. 114) endeavoured to get it
printed in D¹ (BRE. 120 31111 92); but by the summer of 1519 it had not yet
