splendore, qua gloria horum voluminum authores decorare debemus ‘?

quieta est, lucet in tenebris, pulsa loco insistit ac semper haeret,
splendet per sese, neque alienis vnquam sordibus obsolescens aut
pulchritudine priuatur aut gratiam amittit et decus. Huius quidem
laude cum tu, mi Erasme, vnice excellas apud prouincialeis tuos,
sapientissimos et ornatissimos homines, facis vt tuo potissimum

Gazae . . . institutio ii, tit. v0. Louvain.
20 February 1518.

[The preface to Theodori Gazae de linquae Graecae institutione liber secundus, Erasmo
Roterodamo interprete, Louvain, Th. Martens, s. α. This work was undertaloen by
Erasmus in July 1517 ; but was interrupted by the necessity of replying to Faber
(Ep. 616. 5,6). It was originally destined for Afinius (Epp. 616, 638), but the
friction with him moved Erasmus to abandon the idea. Through the autumn
fair at Frankfort he dispatched it to Froben (Epp. 629, 701, 733) to be printed,
with a revision of book i (Ep. 428). But at the same time he decided to dedicate
it in ms. to Fisher (Epp. 653, 667, 784). By November Froben had begun upon
the printing (BRE. 69) ; but meanwhile Erasmus, having received no announce-
ment οἳ Froben‘s acceptance of the book (Ep. 732), gave it to Martens (Ep. 795),
who produced it with this preface about the beginning of March (Ep. 784).

Froben, when he left for the spring fair, regarded his edition as ready (Ep. 801),
but the final part (f0. f3) bears date May 1518. It had been constructed in accord-
ance with Erasmus’ suggestion (Ep. 629. 2,3) out of the first edition; which
evidently had not sold as well as had been expected. Two new sections, the
translation of book ii and the original, were put in at separate points, following
the similar parts of the first edition, and a new title-page was added; but the
original colophon, N ov. 1516, was retained in spite of the new one affixed at the
end of book ii in the Greek. This reconstruction I failed to observe in treating
Ep. 428 ; and in consequence the critical apparatus there needs some remodelling.
Froben’s edition of Nov. 1516 was undertaken without Erasmus’ knowledge (Ep.
575. 1-3)‚ and is a reprint of Martens' of June (a). For three of the other editions
cited the sigla should be changed as follows: Martens' of March 1518 and Feb.
1524 to β1 and βπ, Froben’s of May 1518 to Ὺ. The following critical notes will
then need alteration—6. submolestae αγε molestae β. 49. ac. αγε et 13².
a. τῶν χρυσῶν γ. 62. a: ΜΛ). XVIII Ὑ.

Martens' edition of book ii was not reprinted 3 and this preface is not found
iu any of Froben’s editions So that this is the only source.
