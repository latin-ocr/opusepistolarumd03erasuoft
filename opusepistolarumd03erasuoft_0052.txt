<July 1517.) “

[The Declamatio cle Morte was composed in the circumstances here described (cf.
1. p. 18. 23-6), and after being lost to Erasmus for some years with other papers
which he had left behind in Italy (cf. Epp. 270. 60 n. and 30. 16 n.), it came into
his hands again in Dec. 1516 (cf. Ep. 502. 10,11 n.). He printed it first with the
Querela Pacis in Dec. 1517 (at cf. p. 14); in the subsequent editions, β, -γ, δ;
and in a volume containing the Enchiriolz'on and the De praeparatione ad mortem,
Bas-le, H. Froben and Nic. Episcopius, Aug. 1535, which follows δ. It was also
introduced, without this preface, into the enlarged edition of the De conscribendis
epistolis, Basle, Froben, Aug. 1522 (cf. Ep. 71 iutrod.) as a second example of the
Epistola consolatoria ι addressed to Antony Sucquet, a member of Charles' council,
on the death of his son, perhaps the John Sucquet (†a. 22 March 152}) of ΕΕ. 13.
It is also found in the edition, Basie, H. Froben and Nic. Episcopi-us, 1534 ; but
in the Basle Opera, 1540, i. 372, it is removed.

This preface may be dated with Ep. 603. Li. 8, 9 show that Erasmus expected
to find Glareanus still at Basle. In committing to him the decision whether or
no the Declamatio should be printed, he acted with design. In an unprinted letter
to Myconius, 25 Oct. 1518 (see Fritzsche‚ Glarean, pp. 23‚4), Glareanus says that
he had written a Declamatio mortis contemnendae, and that Erasmus had once
promised to publish it in company with something of his own. For some reason
Erasmus was now unwilling to fulffl this promise3 and evidently hoped by
placing the matter in Glareanus’ hands te be able at least to claim that he had
not acted without giving notice to his friend. But Glareanus, being in Paris,
was not forewarned 3 and in consequence was sorely disappointed to find, instead
of his own composition, a declamation by Erasmus on the same subject]

2. Alexandrum] Stewart (c. 1493—-
9 Sept. 1513), natural sonwof James 1v
of Scotland, with whom he fell at
Flodden. In 1502 he was appointed
Archdeacon of St. Andrews, and in
1504-5 Abp. in succession to his uncle
(Ep. 48. 6 n.). In 1507 he was sent
abroad to study, and settled at Padua,
where he was joined in 1508 by his
natural brother James Stewart, Earl
of Moray (c. 1499—1544: see DNB).
About Dec. Erasmus became his tutor
in rhetoric at Padrm, and the party
moved on to Siena in 1509 (rv. 165—9).
The visit to Rome and Naples(1v. 210-3)
probably took place in April 1509, not
June, as suggested in Ep. 216 introd. ;
since Erasmus, writing in 1528 about
his pupil’s gift of the ring Terminus,
represents that they parted at Siena
(LB. x. 1758 Ε). By 1510, when Alexan-
der reached home, he had received the
Abbey of Dunfermline, and he shortly

became Chancellor of Seotland and
perhaps Cardinal. In 1512 he was
eo-sounder of St. Leonard’s College at
St. Andrews. Erasmus was much
attached to him and mentions him
frequently in his writings: see Aday.
