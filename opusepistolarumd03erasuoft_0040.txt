4. Magister] John Briselot († 11
Sept. 1520) of Mons in Hainault. In
Nov. 1499, when J. Badius dedicated
to him an edition of Bapt. Mantuanus’
De calamitatibus temporum, Paris, T.
Kerver, 4 Sept. 1499, he was ‘schola-
sticus regius', had been for some time
B.D.‚ and was nearinghis D.D. ; which
he obtained in the Serbonne in 1502.
Badius speaks of him also as intimate
with his fellow -Carmelite‚ Laur.
Burell, Bp. of Sisteron 1499-1502. On
4 April 1505 (ἵ) ἓ), being Prior of the
Carmelites at Valenciennes‚ he was
elected Suffragan Bp. of Cambray and
titular Bp. of Beirut; and in 1506-8
received the Benedictine Abbey of
Hautmont, near Maubeuge. He also
held the Benedictine Priory of St.
Saulve, near Valenciennes‚ and a
canonry at Mons, besides other prefer-
ment. After his appointment as con-
fessor to Charles, he was created Abp.
of Oristano and Primate of Sardinia,
23 Dec. 1517 ; but in 1519—20 resigned
and returned to Hautmont. He is
credited with a knowledge of Greek
and Hebrew‚ and left numerous theo-
logical works in MS.

See Sweert ; Legiay, Cameracum Chri-
sfianum; Gams; GC. iii ; and BN. For
Erasmus' opinion of him see Epp. 608,
628, 641, 695, 7943 aud cf. Ep. 739,
20 n. For his age cf. l. 56.

15. D. Heloinus scripsi, qs. Ep. 794. 84‚5:

Ep. 85. 10 n.

13. Clithoueo] Cf. Ep. 594. 14 n.
Clerval, p. 25, shows that he may have
declined the post through reluctance
to leave Paris. He had returned
thither by 7 June 1517. As an adherent
of Faber he would now be out of favour
with Erasmus (cf. 1. 32 n.).

15. Heloinus] In view of Ep. 641
Leclerc's identification may safely be
accepted3 the corruption in the MS.
being perhaps due to an aberration of
Erasmus himself. There is no other
evidence for a translation of the Moria
by Deloynes (Ep. 494).

16. Tunstallo adhesi] Tunstall's
movements may be traced in Brewer
ii as follows: at Antwerp, 28, 3¹ May 3
at Hal, on his way to Tournay, 4 June
(3338, 3343) ; at Brussels‚ returning to
join Charles’ court, 7 June; at Ghent,
9, 17, 19 June; at Bruges, 2 July3 at
Middelburg, 9, 13 July. After leaving
Antwerp he probably met Erasmus
again at Ghent3 cf. Ep. 596 introd.

collationem] Cf. Epp. 373, 384 in-
trodd. and for Tunstall’s help see
the Apoloyia qua respondet, Sec„ f0. ΑΒ,
