F. p. 595: HN: Lond. xvi. 5: LB. 401.

Louvain.
30 March 1519.

[Lipsius’ argument in α is : ‘ Pollicetur missurum se Noui Testamenti seeun-
dariam aeditionem‚ in praesentiarum per magistrum Ruteherum‚ Graece scholae
lectorem, mittens libellum D. Iacobi Latomi, theologiae licentiati, cuius titulus
est De ratione studii theologici. Foelix profecto libellus qui tanti viri calculis
probari meretur.' Against the last sentence he adds in the margin 2 ‘ yronice.‘

The date is confirmed by the mention of Latomus’ book]

3. libellum] A dialogue, De trium
linquar-um et studii theologici ratione. Ant-
werp, M. Hillen‚ 1519 3 the subject
being also stated, An theologo sitnecessaria
trium linguarum peritia. It represented
the conservative point of view against
the new linguistic studies, and was
perhaps directed against Mosellanus
(cf. Ep. 948. 7 n.), but Erasmus thought
himself sufficiently concerned (cf. Epp.
936. 38-41, 970. 11‚2) to reply with an
Apologia refellens mespiciorws quorundam
dictitantium dialogum D. Iacobi Latomi de
tribuslinyuis. . . conscriptum fuisse aduersus
ipsum. This is dated 28 March 1519,
Louvain 3 and was printed first at
Antwerp, J. Theobald, s. α. (cf. p. 559),
and then by Froben, May 1519. BEr¹.

vain, 1519 ; which 1 have not seen.

Latomi] James Masson of Cam-
bron, near Ath in Hainault (1475-—29
May 1544), after studying at Paris
returned to Louvain, and was a pupil
of Adrian of Utrecht (Ep. 171. 12 n.).

In 1504 he became head of the Domus
Pauperum in succession to its founder,
Standonck (Ep. 73. 9 n.). He was
admitted to the University Council
1510, and 14 Aug. 1519 was D.D. z
being at the time tutor to Charles and
Robert, younger brothers of william
Croy (p. 68), and afterwards Bps. of
Tournay and Cambray. In 1526 he
received a canonry at Cambray; and
in 1535 was Professor of Theology and
Canon of St. Peter's at Louvain.

Besides the dialogus mentioned here
he composed in Dec. 1520 a defence of
the action of the Louvain theologians
in condemning Luther’s books, which
was printed by Hillen‚ Antwerp, 8 May
1521 3 and thenceforward he became
one of the leaders of the orthodox
party at Louvain. Indeed, Luther
considered him the most formidable of
any of the adversaries who attacked
him.

His collected works were published
by his nephew after his death, Louvain,
B. Gravius, 29 J uly 1550, with some
hitherto unprinted additions. See F.
Pijper, Bibl. reformatoria Νεενῐαηᾶἰσα, iii
(1905); de Jongh, pp. 173-803 and BN.

eruditum] Against this Lipsius
adds in the margin of α ‘Yronia'.
