S. P. Reddidit eruditissimus Eobanus litteras tuas cum duabus
orationibus licet deprauatissime scriptis. Litteras tuas Dorpio
reddendas curaui. De statu nostro cognosces ex meis ad Rhenanum
litteris, si vacabit legere. Hic annus mihi parum candidus fuit:
faxit Deus Opt. Max. vt succedant feliciores. G<r>atissimus fuit
mihi animus erga me tuus, gratum officium. Salutabis meis verbis
Wolphangum Angtlstanum et Francones humanissimos, quibuscum
postremam egi coenam, ac ceteros qui Erasmo bene volunt. Scintillat
hic quoque pestis, sed modice et aliunde inuecta. Coelum absque
vicio est. Bene vale, doctissime atque humanissime Longicampiane.

Saluta iureconsultum qui nobis orationes in naui pronunciauit.
