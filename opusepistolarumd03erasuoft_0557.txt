pNizholas Berault <Beraldus) of Orleans (c. 1470 — p. 1545) led an active life as
a teacher and as an editor of books. He was a contemporary of John Pyrrhus
d’Angleberme (Ep. 140 introd.)‚ and became Licentiate in Law, probably at
Orleans ; where after a visit to Italy he established a school, which in 1511 was
of some size (Aleander’s Journal, ed. Omont, pp, 19, 20). His first publications
were editions of Bapt. Mantuanus' De vita beata, Paris, J. Badius (c. Ν ov. 1505),
and Valla’s Eleycmtiae, Paris, W. Hopyl (c. Feb. 1508). When Aleander began to
lecture at Orleans in 1510-1, Beraldus was one of his audience3 but c. 1512 he
moved to Paris, to be nearer the advantages for humanistic study now offered by
the capital. He lectured in the colleges and continued to receive pupils into his
house ; and his acti'vity with the printers was great. He produced editions of
Lucretius 1514, Wm. of Auvergne’s Operum Summa and Pliny N. H. 1516, Val.
Maximus and a translation of Lucian's Muscae Encomium 1517, Athanasius 1519,
Appian and a new edition of Craston‘s Greek Dictionary, amplified from Hesy-
chius and Suidas, 1521, Theophylactus 1534: besides undated editions of Suetonius,
a commentary on Aristotle's Oeconomica, and Politian’s Rusticus. About the end
of 1515 he married, as his second wife, the widow of John Barbier, and carried
on that press until in 1518 he found the work too much for him. As a humanist “
he enjoyed the patronage of Stephen Poncher; whom in Aug. 1518 he accom-
pamed to England (cf. Ep. 936. 25 n.)‚ with introductions from Budaeus to Pace,
More and Linacre (BE4. 18-20)‚ and in March 1519 to Narbonne (Ep. 924. 18 n.).

For some years he continued in Paris, taking pupils in his own house (cf.
BE⁴. 67) ; among these c. 1525 being Dolet and Wolmar, the future master
of Calvin. His sympathies at this period were with freedom of thought. I'n
editing Athanasius he had spoken boldly against theologians, and thus incurred
the hostility of the Faculty ; which in 1524 by compelling him to rewrite a pre-
face he had composed for Chrysostom suppressed the undertaking altogether. On
Poncher's death (24 Feb. 1525) he was taken up by John of Orleans, Abp.
of Toulouse (†24 Sept. 1533), and in 1529 was appointed Royal Historian
in succession to Paulus Aemilius (Ep. 136. 1 n.).
